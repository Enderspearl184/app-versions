Sit back. Make yourself a snowstorm margarita. Eat a carrot. Build a gingerbread house. See if you can fit down your chimney. Anything it takes to get into the holiday spirit. But whatever you do, make sure to join us in a toast to the elves at Transit. They’ve powered billions of rides in 2017. Since Santa needs their help to power his sleigh on December 24th, they’ve worked overtime to get you your presents early. Without further ado...<br><br>MONTREAL REAL-TIME! This is not a drill. We’ve been asking Père Noël to bring real-time transit data to the STM for years—until we realized, yo, Père Noël probably doesn’t know how to code. Thankfully the STM does, and delighted us with news that they’re officially launching real-time in Montreal… TODAY!!! You now can watch the epic bus vs. blizzard battle royale play out on your phones, with real-time departures predictions to help you plan smarter, shorter (and less frostbitten) journeys. For now, Transit is the only app in Montreal with real-time data. So tell all your ho-ho-homies—spread the holiday cheer. **Please note, the data will be in beta for the next few weeks. So please be patient as the STM perfects their real-time recipe. Tweet us @transitapp if you find any inaccuracies.**<br><br>ALL-NEW PROFILE VIEW: it’s not just mom’s bad turkey we’re sharing this holiday season—say hello to your bikeshare, carshare, rideshare accounts. All in one place, because you mobility mavericks needed an easier way to manage your myriad profiles. To access Profile View, just tap the gear icon in the top-right corner. Profile View will show your GO crowdsourcing stats in select markets, along with any “Favourited” transit lines. You can manage those favourites—and corresponding alarms and service alerts—inside Profile View. So what? Every account. Plus transit. One app. One page. What could be next???<br><br>JUST-AS-NEW SETTINGS: After you hit the gear icon (for Profile View) slide on over to the next tab: Settings. Here, you can find and edit all of your saved locations (home/work/gym/reindeer stables) for easier trip planning.

When Montreal felt like Hawaii. Then while the update was going out…. there was a huge snowstorm. Thanks for ruining our jokes, clouds.<br><br>***<br><br>Spring is in the air. So is oxygen, and baseballs. Hello warm sky, fresh breeze, and updates to the only app you check more than “Weather”. (Sorry, Snapchat.)<br><br>We started our spring cleaning by making some invisible changes: you won’t see what we did to the Nearby mode, but you’ll probably feel it. Now you can scroll smoother than a Latin scribe. <br><br>Here in Montreal, spring weather means bicycles—it also means you don’t have to shovel your car out of the snow. AKA…... time to freshen up our bike &amp; car-sharing interface!!! We’ve added an extra dose of sunshine: tap on a bike/car, get bigger-n-brighter menus, precise walking distances, and even signup/unlocking/booking buttons (where available).<br><br>Extra thanks to the Transit Houdinis who make bike/cars ~*disappear*~ when you’re zoomed out (so the map isn’t cluttered with dockless bikes) but ~*reappear*~ when you’re zoomed in (so you can size up your myriad options.)<br><br>Now that we’ve tidied up our bikes and cars, time to move on to the yardwork. Chop chop: we trimmed up our branch cards. Before, branch cards would take up big blocks on your screen. If one line direction had 4 branches, and the other direction had 1 branch, both directions would take up “4 branches” worth of space. How bloated!!! So we created an Automagic Resizer, which makes sure each branch direction takes up only as much space as it needs. Minimalism, 1 — Gargantuan Branch Monstrosities, 0.<br><br>But it’s not just tree limbs we’re trimming: branch headsigns are getting compacted too. Now, if a transit direction has twenty different branches all going “West”, instead of saying “West to Branch A”, “West to Branch B”, “West to Branch Z”—we just group them all under a heading that says “West”. No this was not sponsored by Kanye.<br><br>We saved the best for last. So get ready. Take a seat. (A rolling seat, if possible.) Because wheelchair accessibility is coming to Transit. When you flip it on in the settings, wheelchair icons will appear next to all accessible departures and stops.

Sometimes, it’s a worm. Sometimes, it’s a scorpion. Sometimes, it’s the three-year-old Blue Pin Bug™ that boorishly zoomed your map IN every tried you tried to zoom your map OUT… and vice versa. After three years of fermenting in the smokey casks at Transit HQ, our 2016 vintage is finally ready: La muerte de los pines tontos. We tasted. We tested. No bug can stop you now.<br><br>Yes. We’re back from Oaxaca—surf boards strapped to our BIXIs, skin bronzed, bugs blasted, sand grains stuck in our MacBooks. Back in Montreal, we’re catching more waves than ever. Big waves. Pulsing waves. Real-time waves. But that’s not all: alongside our familiar “pulsing wave” icons (which show you the vehicles on the route map that are broadcasting real-time data), we’ve added… shot clocks.<br><br>Is your agency’s bus tracking unreliable? Find out EXACTLY when the location got updated—up to the second. Just open your route’s map or tap GO. We’ll show you the number of seconds (or minutes) since we last got data for your vehicle. A green pulsing Smiley Face? That means a Transit rider is on board, broadcasting positions, via GO, second-by-second (in select markets). A colourful, pulsing bus icon? That means we’re getting data from your agency, and it’s fresh. A grey bus icon? That means the data is stale. Altogether, it’s a simpler design, no taps needed, to help you make better, faster, and more informed decisions on whether to bail on your bus. <br><br>Back to bug city. We’ve implemented many-a-GO fix: like GO bus icons that weren’t showing up (sorry), GO not detecting you were on a ferry (Borat voice: ferry sorry!), and GO telling you your stop was 2 stops away, when it was more like 14.

(Answer: definitely cooler than the hot pepper pizza in our 5000°F industrial oven.)<br><br>Being LA Metro’s official app means that more Angelenos will get to enjoy the perks of Transit’s green mobility machine: better data, more seamless multimodal connections, and faster implementation of new Transit features (like station entrances, which are already live for LA’s Metro Rail.)<br><br>Together, we’ll do LA proud, making sustainable transport more accessible, legitimately fun, and help take cars off the road in the car capital of ze world.<br><br>And if that wasn’t enough — we were also picked to be the official app of RideKC in Kansas City! Two bits of very good news, in what has been an otherwise very crazy last two months…<br><br>Now, as more of you return to public transit (and it’s okay if that’s going to take a while!) we’re coding up a ten-finger frenzy, trying to make Transit perfect. And you know what that means… (New features? Yes. But also… BUG FIXES!)<br><br>- New feature 1: you can now buy bus tickets in Transit for GET Bus in Bakersfield, CA!<br>- New feature 2: walking directions are now available for super short trips. (Instead of just saying: “your destination is 2 minutes away” without giving any directions, we now show you where to go.)<br><br>- Bug fix 1: why were random distant transit agencies appearing on your settings page??? (The transit agency in Burlington, VT is now no longer visible in Montreal. Bernie Sanders, we’re very sorry.)<br>- Bug fixes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: barely noticeable. Except to us.<br><br>There’s nothing more to say, for now. Other than: we love you. (In lieu of a postcard, please send your hellos in five-star form. Your reviews always make our day.)<br><br>Oh PS!

Outside of the Mediterranean, we’ve been working on a few secret projects to make you love Transit even more:<br><br>- new auto-zoom in GO that shows where your bus is, relative to you, no matter how far away it is… because while we prefer bus chases to bull chases, “neither” is our preference ;)<br>- you can now more easily share your in-vehicle crowding status via GO<br>- better screen reader support when you purchase a ticket or bikeshare pass<br>- omg so many new places to buy tickets: Roam Transit (Banff, AB); RTA (Central Maryland); SolTrans (Vallejo, CA); Vine Transit (Napa Valley, CA) <br>- hello yellow taxis in NYC, powered by Curb (joining their sisters: Lyft, Uber, Via)<br>- new smoothie-smooth ridehail experience: tap the “taxi/ridehail” button on the home screen, you now get an instant ETA, as well as a price estimate to your most likely destination<br>- bugs: crushed with the hot passion of a flamenco dancer<br><br>That’s all from us. If you spot a bug, be lovely and tweet us @transitapp. See what jobs we’re hiring for: transitapp.com/jobs. Want to get notified of new job openings (as well as app updates)?
