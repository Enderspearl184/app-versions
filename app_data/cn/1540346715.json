So beware of the need to engage the landing ROCKETS sooner!<br>As well, for the start-locations other than Valles Marineris, you may need to dive down very close to the surface to pick up as much air density as possible, and use that aero pressure to aim you right back UP again, using gravity during your ballistic trajectory to slow down even MORE!! This may sound crazy, and it sure is... but it is in fact exactly what SpaceX showed when they released their first video on hyperbolic entries! Actually flying it for real in real-time is a bit... hair-raising."},{"version_id":"839761082","version_name":"1.13","version_date":"2021-01-02 18:53:59.000 +0800","version_description":""},{"version_id":"840042883","version_name":"1.15","version_date":"2021-01-15 18:48:04.000 +0800","version_description":"Updated engine sound based on the SN9 static fire from yesterday.<br>We now have the 'raptor honk' sound on shut-down as observed on the pad."}]
