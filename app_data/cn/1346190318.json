使用全新的透视编辑器，您可以通过拖放操作，从强大的过滤规则中建立自己的视图。您可以将规则分组为“全部”、“任何”及“无”组合，以精确获得您在寻找的内容。此功能需要一个已经迁移到最新格式的数据库，OmniFocus 2.12.2 for Mac 及 2.22.3 for iOS 支持此功能。\r\n• 多面板模式 - 在较宽的设备上，OmniFocus 现在支持三个面板的视图。您可以显示一个左侧工具条或一个右侧检查器，两者均可“固定”以维持显示。\r\n• 批量编辑 - 现在，您可以使用“编辑”模式来选择多个项，并使用检查器更改所选全部项的属性。\r\n• 重复 - 重复新添了很多选项，包括重复间隔为一周中的一天和一个月中的一天。全新 UI 令配置重复更直观。\r\n• 灵活的通知 - OmniFocus 3

在预测的“视图”选项中，您可以选择“今天”显示的标签。在此板块中，您可以看到所选标签可以使用的项。设置好预测标签后，您可以使用从左到右扫动，以快速为项添加标签。预测标签对没有明确日期、每日规则等的重要项非常实用！\r\n• 交叉预测 - 您无需再将日历事件置于单独板块。现在，这些内容作为行，与到期项混合显示，以便您更精确地了解一天中应完成哪些事项。\r\n• 可自定义的检查器 - OmniFocus 现在默认隐藏检查器中的大多数字段。检查器底部的“显示更多”会显示所有字段，轻按“自定义检查器”后，您可以在“始终显示”和“默认隐藏”群组间拖动行。\r\n• 整理 - 我们在所有视图中添加了 OmniFocus for Mac 风格的整理。当您在三个面板模式中编辑时，动作的可见度得到改善。要在 iPhone 上手动整理，请在大纲上下拉（如同要同步）。在 iPad

Once all of your devices have been updated, you’ll be prompted to migrate your database to support the new feature.\n• Action Status — Updated the logic that determines whether an action is blocked. The rules are as follows:\n  • A task with its own explicit status (completed or dropped) always respects that status.\n  • A task with no tags is available.\n  • A task with any on-hold tag is blocked.\n  • A task with all dropped tags is blocked.\n  • A task with any other mixture of tags is available.\n• Today & Watch (PRO) — When a custom perspective is chosen in Today & Watch settings, the collapsed view (as seen in Complications, the Next Up slot, and the collapsed Today Widget) now shows the first item in a perspective rather than trying to show the most timely action. If you want to keep the old behavior, sort the perspective you choose by Due or Due and Flagged.\n• Dropped Actions — It’s now possible to drop an individual action using the inspector, option-space keyboard shortcut, 3D Touch, or swipe menu. Dropping an item is a great way to preserve an action even though you’ve decided not to do it.\n• External Keyboards — You can now expand and collapse groups in the outline using the left and right arrows on a hardware keyboard.\n• Outline — Added a Show Tags row to View Options for each perspective; un-check it to hide tags in the outline for that perspective.\n• Perspectives — Added Due & Flagged as a new perspective sort criteria for database that have been migrated to the latest version (items with due dates or flags are shown first).\n• Perspectives — You can now filter, sort, and group actions by dropped status.\n• Repeats — Added a Skip item to the 3D Touch and swipe menus for repeating items that drops the current occurrence and schedules the next one.\n• 3D Touch — Fixed a problem where in certain cases the title field didn’t get keyboard focus when using the New Inbox Item Quick Action.\n• Attachments — You can once again drag and drop files to and from the attachment tab of the inspector.\n• Inspector — Fixed a problem where the title for the Inbox Item inspector was mislabeled as “New Inbox Item”.\n• Replace Server Database — You can once again Replace Server Database if you don’t know the encryption passphrase for the database on the server: cancel at the prompt, then choose Replace Without Backing Up.\n• Split Screen — Fixed a crash in split screen on iPad in a future iOS release.\n• Action Groups — Completing an action group no longer explicitly completes every action in that group. Instead, the actions inherit the completed status.\n• Action Status — Actions in projects or action groups that are completed or dropped now inherit their container’s status—similar to the existing behavior of due dates, defer dates, and flags. Incomplete actions with at least one dropped tag inherit a dropped status. The Completed perspective and Availability: Dropped perspective filter rule match actions that inherit a completed or dropped status.\n• Drag and Drop — Made it easier to drop items into the first position of an action group.\n• Localizations — Updated localizations.\n• Selection — Tapping an already-selected item now opens the inspector instead of deselecting (multiple selection in edit mode remains unchanged).\n• Subscriptions — Improved feedback and guidance when signed in to sync using one Omni Account and trying to purchase a subscription with another.\n• Sync — Updated the feedback that OmniFocus gives you when it encounters a sync incompatibility.\n• Smaller Fixes and Improvements — Thanks for sending in your feedback!"},{"version_id":"831862408","version_name":"3.3","version_date":"2019-07-03 07:06:43.000 +0800","version_description":"OmniFocus 3.3 for iOS adds the ability to drop individual actions.\n\n• Database Migration — The ability to drop individual actions requires that all of your syncing devices are running OmniFocus 3.4 for Mac or 3.3 for iOS (or later).

The rules are as follows:\n  • A task with its own explicit status (completed or dropped) always respects that status.\n  • A task with no tags is available.\n  • A task with any on-hold tag is blocked.\n  • A task with all dropped tags is blocked.\n  • A task with any other mixture of tags is available.\n• Today & Watch (PRO) — When a custom perspective is chosen in Today & Watch settings, the collapsed view (as seen in Complications, the Next Up slot, and the collapsed Today Widget) now shows the first item in a perspective rather than trying to show the most timely action. If you want to keep the old behavior, sort the perspective you choose by Due or Due and Flagged.\n• Dropped Actions — It’s now possible to drop an individual action using the inspector, option-space keyboard shortcut, 3D Touch, or swipe menu. Dropping an item is a great way to preserve an action even though you’ve decided not to do it.\n• External Keyboards — You can now expand and collapse groups in the outline using the left and right arrows on a hardware keyboard.\n• Outline — Added a Show Tags row to View Options for each perspective; un-check it to hide tags in the outline for that perspective.\n• Perspectives — Added Due & Flagged as a new perspective sort criteria for database that have been migrated to the latest version (items with due dates or flags are shown first).\n• Perspectives — You can now filter, sort, and group actions by dropped status.\n• Repeats — Added a Skip item to the 3D Touch and swipe menus for repeating items that drops the current occurrence and schedules the next one.\n• 3D Touch — Fixed a problem where in certain cases the title field didn’t get keyboard focus when using the New Inbox Item Quick Action.\n• Attachments — You can once again drag and drop files to and from the attachment tab of the inspector.\n• Inspector — Fixed a problem where the title for the Inbox Item inspector was mislabeled as “New Inbox Item”.\n• Replace Server Database — You can once again Replace Server Database if you don’t know the encryption passphrase for the database on the server: cancel at the prompt, then choose Replace Without Backing Up.\n• Split Screen — Fixed a crash in split screen on iPad in a future iOS release.\n• Action Groups — Completing an action group no longer explicitly completes every action in that group. Instead, the actions inherit the completed status.\n• Action Status — Actions in projects or action groups that are completed or dropped now inherit their container’s status—similar to the existing behavior of due dates, defer dates, and flags. Incomplete actions with at least one dropped tag inherit a dropped status. The Completed perspective and Availability: Dropped perspective filter rule match actions that inherit a completed or dropped status.\n• Drag and Drop — Made it easier to drop items into the first position of an action group.\n• Localizations — Updated localizations.\n• Selection — Tapping an already-selected item now opens the inspector instead of deselecting (multiple selection in edit mode remains unchanged).\n• Subscriptions — Improved feedback and guidance when signed in to sync using one Omni Account and trying to purchase a subscription with another.\n• Sync — Updated the feedback that OmniFocus gives you when it encounters a sync incompatibility.\n• Smaller Fixes and Improvements — Thanks for sending in your feedback!"},{"version_id":"831862408","version_name":"3.3","version_date":"2019-07-03 07:06:43.000 +0800","version_description":"OmniFocus 3.3 for iOS adds the ability to drop individual actions.\n\n• Database Migration — The ability to drop individual actions requires that all of your syncing devices are running OmniFocus 3.4 for Mac or 3.3 for iOS (or later).
