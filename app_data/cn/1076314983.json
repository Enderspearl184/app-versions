Ok, don’t do this until you update to the latest version ;)\n\n* Ads Balancing\nWe know PS Deals isn’t perfect… It isn’t because of ads!\nWe reduced the amount of pop-ups and balanced the amount of ads displayed across the app (less in lists, but appear in games pages sometimes). We can’t remove ads completely, but this change should improve your experience. And don’t forget - Premium subscription will remove ads completely, even if you won’t renew it later.\n\n* Open in Safari\nOpen any game or add-on in Safari or share link with friend. You’ll find new buttons in the bottom of every game page.\n\n* Bug fixes\n\nIf you have ideas on how to improve PS Deals - feel free to contact us at support@bigga.me. For bug reports or help use the same email (not Reviews in the App Store, please), so we can investigate the issue and reply to you directly.\nThank you for using PS Deals!"},{"version_id":"822922468","version_name":"2.3","version_date":"2017-07-23 04:58:58.000 +0800","version_description":"We hope you are enjoying PS Deals and this hot summer!
