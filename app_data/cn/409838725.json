We've been hard at work to create some new tweak for your masterpieces and add some much-requested features. Here's what's new:<br>- Split &amp; Duplicate: We have added the possibility to split and duplicate all the timeline elements. Editing will be now smoother than ever.<br>- Music Section Restyle: the music section has a brand new look and a lot of new amazing features:<br>1) Now, all music tracks have their duration and artist name next to them. Finally, you can tell your friends who's the genius behind that magic track you use in all your videos! <br>2) Additionally, Splice now remembers the songs you used in your past projects and suggests them to you in a new category called \"Recently Used\".
