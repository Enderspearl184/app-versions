Apple calls this Handoff. We’ve begun to add support for it, allowing you to seamlessly switch between devices when you’re searching through results or browsing adverts. You'll hear more about this (and see it in action) in future versions of the app.\n\nLastly, we’re providng some of our users with an advanced preview of the advert screen. After many conversations with our users and a review of the feedback we’ve received about its presentation, we’ve arrived at a design that, we feel, highlights the most important information, prioritises photos and videos, and provides greater clarity.\n\nWe recognise that there’s always room for improvement - nothing is ever perfect.
