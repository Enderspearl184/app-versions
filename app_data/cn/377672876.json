You can quickly access your existing photos and your documents stored in the Files app. A press on the + button lets you directly import your documents from Photos and Files.<br>- Quick Actions. We introduce Quick Actions which let you quickly edit your scan right after snapping the picture – or delete it if you are unhappy. As a consequence, we have removed the \"Manual\" mode as it's now replaced with these Quick Actions.<br>- Improved image processing. We have perfected the post-processing of document shadows which means that Genius Scan is much better at removing them.<br><br>We hope you will like this new release! We know there are changes that will affect some of you but know that we took a lot of care and thinking to make sure this was a largely positive change for everyone in terms of UX and safety.
