Check out what’s new below:\n\n- You can now divide your project into Sections. Add a Section from the three dots menu in the top right of any project, then add tasks by dragging them into the section. Try using Sections to arrange your projects by stage (Research, Planning, Launch) or by timeline (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3).\n\n- Manage every detail about a task – its due date, assignee, labels, sub-tasks, comments, and more – in one place with new Task View. Simply tap on the task to see it. \n\n- It’s now easier to manage your sub-tasks right from Task View. Tap on a task to open Task view and add, view and complete its sub-tasks in context.\n\n- Add tasks and sub-tasks right where you want them inside your projects using the new Dynamic Add button. Simply drag the add button to the spot where you want to create the task. You can also add new Sections by dragging the button to the far left of the project.\n\n- Your Labels list will now be divided into “Personal” and “Shared” labels.  Whenever someone adds a label to a task in a shared project, you’ll see it in your Shared labels; All the labels you create yourself go into your Personal labels. For those of you who collaborate in Todoist, this change should keep your label list much more organized and manageable.\n\n- Adding tasks just got easier with the more intuitive, redesigned Quick Add.  You’ll see small tags below the task name that display the due date, project, and task assignee. You can also now immediately set a reminder using the clock icon.\n\n- Enjoy a more coordinated look across the app with colorful, redesigned icons on every platform.\n\n- You can now see your completed tasks right within your project. Simply select “Show completed tasks” from the three dots menu and you’ll see checked-off tasks right in your project list. You can see them in task view, too.\n\n- You’ll notice a more reliable, more responsive Todoist across the board thanks to a handful of user interface and under-the-hood updates and bug fixes. These also lay the foundation for powerful new features around the corner."},{"version_id":"833610937","version_name":"12.0.5","version_date":"2019-11-15 17:40:16.000 +0800","version_description":"A few bug fixes and improvements to keep your Todoist running smoothly.\n\nFor more info on what's new and how to use it, follow us on Twitter @Todoist or subscribe for updates at the Doist blog: doist.com/blog."},{"version_id":"833632951","version_name":"12.0.6","version_date":"2019-11-25 20:22:12.000 +0800","version_description":"- [New] You can now drag and drop to reorder sub-tasks in the Task View!\n- [Fixed] Free users couldn't access existing task and project comments.
