It's a big update!<br>- All alarms are now set directly on the Apple Watch in a rather tasty new way.<br>- If you use AutoSleep &amp; have WatchOS 5 you can now set advanced ultra smart alarms. These allow you to set a sleep goal, quality goal or sleep bank goal. AutoWake can then do things like set an alarm every Friday after you achieve 8 hours sleep but no later than 7:30AM with an intelligent reminder 60 minutes before the best time to go to bed. Ultra smart alarms can help you hit your sleep goal as well as to prevent oversleeping. <br>- Scheduled backup alarms are now both more flexible and more straightforward. <br>- iPhone app is greatly simplified. <br>- Support for every Infograph complication format on the Series 4 Watch. <br>- Smartwake options now include \"bump\" only. This will tap you every 5 minutes before your final alarm time to take you out of deeper sleep. <br>- You can now change the voice to use for confirmations and safety alarms. <br>Hope you like it! Pleasant dreams."}]
