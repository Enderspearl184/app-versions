Uses sliders to provide unlimited color choices.\n- Added a customizable wake-up message.\n- Added import of phone numbers & email addresses into the Notes field from the Address Book (Contacts).\n- Added a Restore Purchase button for reactivating a previous purchase of the Extras Package (on the same device and/or other devices that share the same iTunes account).\n- Fixed the Silent Mode titlebar icon to work properly.\n- Added an optional Silent Mode alert when you exit Alarmed. This can be turned on or off via Settings | General.\n- Plus lots of small enhancements, fine-tuning and bug-fixes.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The 2.1.1 update broke Sleep Timers (they will stop when the screen locks and external audio mode won't stop audio properly). A temporary workaround for regular sleep timers is to go to Settings | By Alarm Type | Wake-Up Panel Auto-Lock and turn Sleep Timer Active to ON. This will keep your screen from locking while the sleep timer is active as long as the wake-up panel is showing. Unfortunately there isn't a workaround for the problem with external audio mode. A bugfix update has been submitted and should be out soon.
