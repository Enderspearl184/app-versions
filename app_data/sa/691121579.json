Please read the change log carefully...<br><br>This version of AdBlock for iOS, which brings a lot of major changes in the app.<br>First of all, we had to drop VPN based ad blocking. This was required to keep AdBlock in the App Store. To reward this loss to our beloved users, we've worked very hard to introduce the new DNS proxy feature, which now puts you in control of the domain name resolution process (basically it's a local DNS server). AdBlock becomes a powerful tool, which allows you to monitor which domains are contacted from your device. You can now assign any IP address to any domain, which puts you in total control of if and how you're accessing all kinds of content on the Internet. It's not just about ads anymore. You can use this features for much more advanced scenarios, including iOS app development and testing. <br>Second of all, we're introducing a Safari Content Blocker extension as an addition to our other exciting new feature. To enable AdBlock in Safari, please go to \"iOS Settings -&gt; Safari -&gt; Content Blockers\" and enable \"AdBlock\". Now you can use our app to subscribe to some of the popular filter subscription lists, like EasyList. You can also add your own sets of rules, including specialised and regional filters to fully customise your Safari browsing experience.<br><br>This is just the first of many releases from the v4 line of AdBlock. We're excited to bring you new features and we're not stopping here. Our goal is to put you in charge of your iOS device.<br><br>On top of the major changes, there is quite a lot going on under the hood. We've squished many bugs, enhanced iOS 11 compatibility and improved stability of the app.<br><br>Please contact support@adblockios.com if you have any questions about the new features and how to use them.
