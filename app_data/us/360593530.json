What's new in 8.0 ***\n\nThis is a major update for Notability! We've added powerful new features: handwriting recognition, handwriting to text conversion, view two notes side-by- side (Multi-Note), quickly switch notes without needing to go back to the Library, and an updated Help Center.\n\nHandwriting Search (for iPad)\n• Handwriting is now searchable from the Library and within a specific note.\n• Handwriting can also be converted to text.\n• The first time you launch Notability, your library will be indexed. After that, your handwriting will be searchable!
