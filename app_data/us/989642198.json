Connect to your bank and MoneyCoach will automatically get all the transactions from your bank. <br><br>• Transfers 2.0<br>From now on, transfers between multi-currency accounts happen in the currencies of those accounts, no more converting to the main currency. You all have been asking for this for a long while now so here it is. Now show your support by considering subscribing to MoneyCoach Premium or by leaving a review for the app.<br><br>• Overview Profiles<br>With each update we try to introduce elements that make MoneyCoach easier to understand and less “scarier” especially for new users. Now when you scroll at the bottom of the Overview, you will read the number of cards available to add to your Overview. If you tap “Edit” you will see 3 new profiles, Casual, Experienced and Pro, which when tapped change the cards available in the Overview. Try the profiles, modify the cards and find what works best for you.<br><br>• Top Categories<br>We introduced a new card in the Overview which will show your top five expense categories you spent the most money on for the period. Try the Casual profile if you use MoneyCoach just to keep track of your budget and expenses for the period. Or add this new card to your own custom Overview, it is all up to you.<br><br>• MoneyCoach Blue<br>Premium subscribers can now find a MoneyCoach Blue app icon as a new custom app icon.

You can set it up on the Repeat tab while adding or editing a repeating transaction.

This is a premium feature and requires an active premium subscription to access it.<br><br>Design Tweaks<br><br>We changed and tweaked the design of so many small things. For example, we tweaked the design of the New Transfer screen where now you can quickly understand that, if you are transferring between multi-currency accounts, you can tap on the right side to edit the converted amount directly. We also added new icons replace old ones, tweaked some of the illustrations, tweaked the way Accounts icons look in Light and Dark modes, and a lot of other stuff.<br><br>Tweaks, Fixed &amp; Improvements<br><br>This update also includes a lot of tweaks and fixes to make your experience with the app better.

Now you can place small, medium, and large widgets on your screen to quickly glance at your budgets to limit yourself from overspending or track the progress of your goals for that motivational push. My personal favorite of the new widgets is the Quick Actions widget which allows you to quickly add an expense, income, transfer or even access Quick Entry. It is stupidly fast and you are going to love using it. The new widgets are powerful, helpful, and extremely motivational.<br><br>New iPad Experience<br>We completely redesigned the MoneyCoach experience for iPadOS 14. We implemented a new sidebar in a three-column split view which dramatically enhances and takes the iPad experience to a whole another level. Quickly navigate to anywhere in the app via the primary sidebar, explore more information in the supplementary sidebar, and delve deep into the details in the secondary sidebar. The amount of work that went into this redesign is crazy, but the end result is more than worth it.<br><br>Budgets 2.0<br>We updated the design of the Budgets screens and added the ability to personalize your budgets with emojis. We also changed the way how the progress bar behaves, instead of filling up the more you spend on a budget, it now depletes until there’s nothing left for you to spend in the budget. One final thing,  the default period when creating a new budget is now Month.<br><br>Watch App Overhaul<br>We completely rewrote the Apple Watch companion app. This should make for a better experience when using the watch app in combination with the rest of your connected devices.<br><br>Optimized for iOS 14<br>With every new iOS version comes a lot of new cool features and tweaks that we support day one. We made a lot of under the hood changes, things you don’t get to see, to support these new technologies. What you can see are the new date pickers, new icons, design changes, custom menus for sorting, and much more.<br><br>We put a lot of love and care into this massive new update and we hope you like what you see.

What’s new:<br><br>New - Bulk Edit Transactions<br>This is an extremely powerful premium feature that will allow you to quickly edit the category/subcategory or account for multiple transactions in one go. Bulk editing takes the MoneyCoach experience to the next level as it grants you more control over multiple transactions at once. <br><br>Tap the Edit button in the Transactions list, select the transactions, and tap the ellipsis icon to quickly edit the category/subcategory or the account for these transactions. What’s even more impressive is that you can do this from anywhere you see the Transactions list, so Accounts, Budgets, Reports, etc. Oh, it also works when you search in the Transaction list. We are super stoked to see what you think about this new powerful tool!<br><br>New - Category Search Enhanced<br>In the last update, we introduced search inside the category selection screen. Now we’ve improved it even further where if you select a category the keyboard dismisses immediately leaving space for the subcategories. There are also empty states for subcategories. On Mac, you can also Command + F to search categories. <br><br>Plus, we included a switch to disable the search when the screen pops up offering more control and personalization over your MoneyCoach experience.<br><br>Siri Shortcuts Enhanced<br>You can now add a custom transaction via the Siri Shortcut.
