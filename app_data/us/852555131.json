But the #1 requested feature? To harness the power of video within the simplicity of Spark to communicate with even greater impact. And now it’s here.<br><br>·  Trim: One-touch trimming lets you pick the right start and end of the clip you want in your video. <br><br>·  Continue clip: Unlike complicated video editors, your clip can easily be parsed into a series of slides of various durations. To make a new point over the same video clip, simply break it up into a new slide by tapping the “Continue” button. Then overlay text, an icon, adjust the volume, or add narration to the slides—it will play seamlessly.<br><br>  ·  Adjust volume: Add a music track to lend an overall mood to your video. Then highlight key moments of sound from your clips or narration to engage your audience. Sounds from your clips can be set as ambient background, emphasized, or muted.<br><br>·  Align video to narration: We’ll automatically align the video clip to the length of your narration.
