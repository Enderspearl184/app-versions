Here is MyAdsense 2.0.4! It just rolls off the tongue doesn't it?! I ended up adding much more in this update than I initially intended, all of which I hope make the experience using MyAdsense even better.\n<br>\n<br>Pull to Refresh:\n<br>I'm sorry! I know you've all been having to use the app with a terrible pull to refresh experience, but I'm *confident* that it's working as it should now. I just hope it behaves itself! If anyone does experience any problems, please do let me know!\n<br>\n<br>Suggest a Feature:\n<br>Want to have your say on future updates? Go to the Settings tab and tap on 'Suggest New Features' and put your ideas forward! Whether you want support for Apple Watch, fancy widgets for your iPhone, some additional metrics, or even just some shiny new app icons to choose from - I'm all ears.\n<br>\n<br>Haptic Feedback:\n<br>I received feedback (get it?!) from some users that the use of haptic feedback was a little excessive, and although I quite like the haptics, I appreciate that some may not. Therefore if you head to the Settings tab, you can now turn off haptic feedback.\n<br>\n<br>Plain Colours:\n<br>I've been playing around with some of the colours within the app, and you can now reduce the colours for a more sleek look. This is something I'm continuing to explore, so may add more options to this in a future update.\n<br>\n<br>What's New:\n<br>Forgot what's new? Want to remind yourself what it is you've had in the latest update? Rather than view the change log, you can go to the About section under settings and tap on 'What's New?' which will bring up this dialogue box to jog your memory.\n<br>\n<br>Redesign:\n<br>I've had a play around with the design in a few areas - namely Settings and the welcome message. Hopefully you think it looks a little prettier!\n<br>\n<br>Bug Fixes:\n<br>Ironed out a few of those pesky bugs!\n<br>\n<br>That's it! As you can see, I've been quite busy the last few weeks, and I really hope that you enjoy the update. I may try and get some sleep over the next week or two, so in the meantime - please use the feedback form to put forward your ideas, I would love to hear from you.\n<br>\n<br>As always, just a reminder as well that if you're enjoying the app then I'd really appreciate it if you could spare a few minutes of your time to leave a rating on the App Store, and a review if possible. As an independent developer it really goes a long way in boosting the apps visibility. Tips are also most welcome, which can be found in the Settings tab.\n<br><br>Thanks for your ongoing support of MyAdsense!\n<br>\n<br>Chris"},{"version_id":"836443754","version_name":"2.0.5","version_date":"2020-06-17 11:45:03.000 +0800","version_description":"Version 2.0.5 includes fixes for an issue in the last update.
