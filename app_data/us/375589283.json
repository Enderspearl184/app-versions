Not only you can create new accounts in Parcel using “Sign in with Apple”, you can also convert your existing Parcel account if you want to. Parcel does not ask for name, email or password when using “Sign in with Apple”.\n\nSiri Shortcuts\nParcel now has a new Siri shortcut that allows you to see the latest information about your active deliveries. It is very simple to use and you can set it up in the app settings.\n\nDark Mode (iOS 13)\nNot much to say, Parcel supports dark mode in iOS 13 and it looks great.\n\nSupport for Contextual Actions (iOS 13)\nNow you can tap and hold on a delivery to perform actions on it. You can either track on website, find on map or mark as completed right from the deliveries list. This allows you to save time because normally to access those actions you would need to open a delivery first and then tap on the actions button.\n\nImprovements:\n• when you search for a delivery in Spotlight, you can tap and hold on it to see its full history\n• delivery status icons in the main list are adjusted in size according to your system font size (iOS 13)\n• when there is a suggestion from the app to change delivery carrier, you will see a new icon for that"},{"version_id":"833034037","version_name":"6.1","version_date":"2019-11-20 07:29:30.000 +0800","version_description":"• new delivery filter mode: \"Recent Deliveries\".
