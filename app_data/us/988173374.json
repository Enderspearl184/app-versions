With a brand new UI design, Polarr 6.0 makes everything you previously enjoy doing easier, faster and more intuitive. \n\nTo help our team focus on building features dedicated to style creation, we decided to remove the text, shape, spot removal and several other features in the app. Some of them will make a comeback in future releases. Despite we believe these are correct decisions for our app to grow further, our team apologizes to some of you for losing some of your favorite features in the release.
