We really do. So, in our latest release we focused on bug fixes and improvements to both the free and paid versions of MyPlate to ensure the best possible app experience. We hope you’ll find this version to be more consistent, efficient and reliable. <br><br>Curious? Here’s a list of some of the improvements we implemented:<br><br>1. We fixed bugs that prevented Sodium and Cholesterol from displaying the correct micronutrient values.<br><br>2. For the custom foods you create, we resolved a synchronization issue that was preventing these foods from being displayed.<br><br>3. Now when you track a food, we’ve improved the look and experience of the Food Detail screen. Not only did we add a cleaner, more contemporary design, we focused on improving two key aspects:<br><br>3.1 Improved Nutritional Facts label:<br>For the free version of the app, we kept the same functionality but made it better in terms of visibility and design. The Nutritional Facts Label displays the macro &amp; micro nutrients breakdown of the food relevant to a 2,000 calorie diet. We also enhanced the look of this label and made it easier to see the values at a glance. And it’s now easier for you to see this label since it’s displayed directly on the Food Details screen.<br>For the paid version of the app, we implemented a new feature we’re calling Smart Nutritional Facts Label, which shows you nutrition information as a percent of your daily goals! As a premium user, you can now see the macro and micro breakdown of the food you track as it relates to your personal caloric and nutritional goals. This will help you understand the percentage of calories, carbs, fat, protein, cholesterol, sodium, etc... as you track toward your daily goals.<br><br>3.2 Important new functionality: You can now re-assign a food from one meal to another. How often have you accidently tracked a food for lunch that was actually meant to be logged as breakfast or dinner? Now you can easily re-assign that food to the right meal with just couple of taps by using the new action button: Meal. <br><br>As always, we’re here to help!
