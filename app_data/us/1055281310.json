To use dynamic scenes, press the play button that appears on the scene card.  <br>• Speed: With this initial release, the dynamic effects will be subtle. You may not notice that your lights are changing at first. A future release will let you control the speed of dynamic scenes — stay tuned for the update! <br>• Hue scene gallery: Only color scenes you’ve added to My scenes from the Hue scene gallery can be dynamic. In the future, you’ll be able to make any color scene — even custom ones you create yourself — dynamic.  <br>• Update lights: Make sure that all your color-capable Philips Hue lights are updated and that they’ve been connected to power for at least 24 hours. Enable automatic updates to make this a bit easier! <br><br>PHILIPS HUE + SPOTIFY <br>Unleash music with light! Philips Hue + Spotify is the first deep lighting and music integration that intertwines light and sound. Match the unique sounds of any song played with Spotify to the movement of your lights. Light scripts are tuned perfectly to the metadata of each song, matching the genre and mood. <br>• Enable early access — which is available to everyone in the Philips Hue app. Tap the “Turn on early access” button in the What’s new section of the Explore tab. <br>• Get early access program will gradually roll out worldwide over the course of 10-days."}]
