It automatically filters what you have scheduled to log today, moves things down when they're taken care of so you can focus, and makes it easy to look at past days' logs, so it's a lot better for logging than the Dashboard. Since logging is by far the most common action, we want to make that the view with the best logging experience is the default view.<br><br>The Dashboard is best for viewing your current progress on all your trackers, regardless of when they're due to be logged, so it's a great way to check on how you're doing on everything in one place. If you'd still prefer to log from the Dashboard, the app will keep you on that tab unless it goes out of memory because it hasn't been opened in a while, in which case tapping the tab will get you back to the Dashboard.<br><br>We also added a automatic smart filter to the Today view for weekly and monthly habits so they won't show on their When to Log days if their Goal is already met for the week/month. For example, you could set your Work Out habit to be logged Every Day, with a Goal of 5 times per week, and if you've worked out every day then the last two days of the week it won't show up on the Daily Goals view, which will save you a step.<br><br>The widget was also improved and we fixed a few bugs like the Widget showing blank for some people, and the Week Starts On &amp; Alert Sound settings reverting in some cases.<br><br>Best of luck with all your goals &amp; habits!<br>Kyle, Brian, Jason, Tim &amp; Jonathan"},{"version_id":"827595067","version_name":"7.2.2","version_date":"2018-06-20 01:38:29.000 +0800","version_description":"This is a quick follow-up release to fix a few crashes from the update with the Daily Goals view as the primary tab.<br><br>Best of luck with all your goals &amp; habits!<br>Kyle, Brian, Jason, Tim &amp; Jonathan"},{"version_id":"827677548","version_name":"7.3","version_date":"2018-06-27 15:05:49.000 +0800","version_description":"Here's another update for you:<br>- Added a nice little haptic feedback when logging<br>- Goal Streak is now shown in Due section for added motivation<br>- Added text explaining current plan on Account page<br>- Fixed a couple bugs and updated some buttons<br><br>We also added a link in the menu to an app that works really nicely with Strides.
