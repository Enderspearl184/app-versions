(Unfortunately, we still can't see the status of the Text Message Filtering feature, so you have to visit Settings for that.)<br><br>We also fixed a few bugs.<br><br>A few things to note when using the app:<br><br>Does Family Sharing cover premium features? <br>No. Family Sharing only works on the free version of Malwarebytes for iOS. Premium features are limited to the purchaser’s Apple ID. To learn more about Family Sharing restrictions, head to the following link: https://support.apple.com/HT203046<br><br>I already purchased a multi-device Malwarebytes license, can I use it on Malwarebytes for iOS?<br>No. iOS apps, like Malwarebytes for iOS, are only available on the App Store. If you have an unused product license that you'd like to use on Malwarebytes for iOS, please contact Malwarebytes support at Support-iOS@Malwarebytes.com to learn about your options.<br><br>I already use Malwarebytes for my computer, can I just add an iOS device to my plan? <br>No. Malwarebytes for iOS must be purchased on the App Store.<br><br>Why doesn’t Malwarebytes for iOS include a malware scanner?<br>It is not possible for an iOS app to scan for malware. Fortunately, the risk of getting malware on an iOS device is extremely low and Apple has a stringent review process regarding app admission into the App Store."},{"version_id":"828712108","version_name":"1.1.1","version_date":"2018-10-09 13:32:42.000 +0800","version_description":"This version adds native support for French and Spanish."},{"version_id":"829103793","version_name":"1.2.0","version_date":"2018-11-12 20:14:43.000 +0800","version_description":"Improvements<br>• Added ability to whitelist websites<br>• Added 3D Touch options to the Malwarebytes app icon<br>• Added tabs for reporting/blocking and allowing phone numbers<br><br>Stability/issues fixed<br>• Fixed minor issues"},{"version_id":"829433515","version_name":"1.2.1","version_date":"2018-11-28 17:34:08.000 +0800","version_description":"Stability/issues fixed<br>• Fixed a problem that caused calls from numbers in Contacts to be blocked"},{"version_id":"829536731","version_name":"1.2.2","version_date":"2018-12-12 20:53:18.000 +0800","version_description":"We fixed a few minor bugs"},{"version_id":"830161398","version_name":"1.3.0","version_date":"2019-02-01 15:06:10.000 +0800","version_description":"Improvements<br>• Minor user interface improvements<br><br>Stability/issues fixed<br>• Fixed minor issues"},{"version_id":"830439456","version_name":"1.4.0","version_date":"2019-05-02 17:32:30.000 +0800","version_description":"Improvements<br>• Added a Security News feature, to display news from the Malwarebytes blog<br>  - To add Security News widget to the Today View, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207122<br>• Improved website whitelisting<br><br>Stability/issues fixed<br>• Fixed minor issues"},{"version_id":"831229026","version_name":"1.4.1","version_date":"2019-08-01 18:32:25.000 +0800","version_description":"Fixed minor bugs... nothing anyone even noticed, as far as we're aware."},{"version_id":"832841171","version_name":"1.4.2","version_date":"2019-10-30 17:06:00.000 +0800","version_description":"We fixed some minor bugs in iOS 13, including improvements to the display in dark mode."},{"version_id":"833850417","version_name":"1.4.3","version_date":"2019-12-06 19:03:02.000 +0800","version_description":"Fixed a support URL that will be changing in the future."},{"version_id":"834183033","version_name":"1.4.4","version_date":"2020-01-30 21:14:51.000 +0800","version_description":"Improvements<br>• Improved ease of use of website whitelisting<br><br>Stability/issues fixed<br>• Improved iOS 13 support<br>• Improved stability of the Security News widget<br>• Minor bug fixes and improvements"}]
