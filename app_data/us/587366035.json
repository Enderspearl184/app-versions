Definitely check out the new Format feature for the Text tool, it’s pretty cool.\n\nAnd if you’ve ever thought to yourself, “you know what Picsart’s missing? A fourth way to remove backgrounds.” Then congrats to you, we’ve added a fourth way to remove backgrounds. Now whenever you add a new photo, you’ll get quick access to the brand new Remove BG tool, that lets you do just that. \n"},{"version_id":"844605723","version_name":"18.3.3","version_date":"2021-10-12 03:04:35.000 +0800","version_description":"You’re kicking off a fresh new edit.

But we’re not stopping there. This update drops the mother of all remove background tools! Going forward, not only you’ll find the Remove BG directly in the main toolbar, but you’ll be able to both remove and change your entire design’s background all in one go. Plus a whole host of settings and features that we think will make your editing life a whole lot easier.\n\nIt’s been a long time coming, but we just merged the Perspective and Flip/Rotate tools into the Crop tool. You had to jump through some serious hoops before, if you were cropping a photo and decided to flip it halfway through. Well, no more! Now you can do all that without it being a nine-step process for every minor change.\n\nIf you’ve been with us for a while and you enjoy editing videos, this one’s for you. It’s been a good while since we’ve added any exclusive effects for our Video Editor, so we think it’s time we fixed that. Similar to what a certain viceroy once said, now there are two of them. And there are many more yet to come. With a new video effect slotted to drop each week for a few months at least, Video Editor fans have a LOT to look forward to. \nWe’ve also revisited our push notifications system. We think it needed some work to bring it up to the standards everyone expects of Picsart. We’ve updated our system and gave the visuals a lift. So expect to see some nifty stuff from us on your home screen in the near future.\n\n"},{"version_id":"845680524","version_name":"18.7.3","version_date":"2021-12-06 13:51:17.000 +0800","version_description":"Here at Picsart we’re all about providing you with the best tools that will help you tap into your creativity.
