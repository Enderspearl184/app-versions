This 'refresh' was causing problems in returning to the homescreen unintentionally, and breaking the sidebar menu. This has been fixed. \n- Some older devices were crashing on certain articles - this has now been fixed. \n- On the issue menu screen, the lowest dropdown (Careers) was being cut off on certain devices. This has now been fixed."},{"version_id":"832329772","version_name":"1.2.1","version_date":"2019-08-11 03:03:30.000 +0800","version_description":"Minor bug fixes"},{"version_id":"840951156","version_name":"1.3.1","version_date":"2021-03-19 00:54:45.000 +0800","version_description":"Bux fixes and regular maintenance."}]
