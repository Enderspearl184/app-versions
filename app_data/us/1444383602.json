Tap on the pen tool icon in the toolbar twice to access them\n- Strokes you draw can snap to other stroke endpoints which allows you to create perfect shapes with multiple strokes. If the shape is closed, it can be selected and edited as a whole instead of only selecting the single lines\n\n\n### New “selected state” for text boxes\n- Tapping on a text box once will select it so that you can make edits to the text box as a whole without bringing up the keyboard right away\n- You can move selected text boxes or change the style easily\n- Double tap on a text box to start typing\n\n### New toolbar layout and styles\n- The text tool receives an improved contextual area so that the style options are easier to access\n- A new drop shadow option has been added to the text box style options\n- We updated the FontAPI so that custom system fonts are now visible in GoodNotes 5 on iOS 14\n"},{"version_id":"837939447","version_name":"5.6.0","version_date":"2020-09-25 07:37:40.000 +0800","version_description":"We're excited to introduce improved shape drawing and updates to the text tool: Draw and hold with the pen and highlighter, support for curves, subsequent shape editing, faster text style selection, text box drop shadow and more.

graphs, coordinate systems... When taking notes, we need to use the same objects over and over again. The new Elements feature lets you import and save objects or groups of objects to a collection from where you can add them to the page again. No more copy and paste between different notebooks or hectic redrawing when time is short.\n\n\n### SAVING ELEMENTS ###\nGoodNotes comes with some built-in Element collections that you can use to decorate or enhance your notes. \nOf course, you can also add your own elements:\n1. Select something with the Lasso Tool > tap on the selection again > tap “Add as Element”\n2. Select an image with the Image tool > Then tap on it again > Add as Element\n3. Open the Elements picker > tap and hold on the mini thumbnail of a collection at the bottom > “Edit” > Import images from Camera Roll or Files\n\n### INSERTING ELEMENTS ###\nInserting elements work similarly to inserting images with the image tool:\nSelect the Elements tool > tap anywhere on the page > select the Element you want to insert.\n\nYou can also use drag and drop to add elements from the Elements picker or from the contextual area that includes your recently used Elements for faster access.\n\nTips for Pros:\nWhen you save an Element, the format is preserved, which means all objects are fully editable when you add them back to a page. For example, you can save a hand-drawn table with placeholder text boxes for the table headers. After adding the Element to the page, you can update the placeholder text with the text tool or erase columns you don’t need.\n\n\n### ORGANIZING ELEMENTS ###\nElements are organized in collections. When saving an element, you can choose to add it to an existing collection or create a new one. You can delete Elements in collections, move them around, and import more.\n\nYou can learn more about how to use Elements by visiting our blog on medium.goodnotes.com and following us on Instagram (@goodnotes.app) and on Twitter (@goodnotesapp)."},{"version_id":"842025025","version_name":"5.7.0","version_date":"2021-05-03 11:55:01.000 +0800","version_description":"Introducing Elements - Save and reuse frequently needed objects across all of your notebooks.\n\nStickers, stamps, headers, sticky-notes, basic shapes, graphs, coordinate systems...
