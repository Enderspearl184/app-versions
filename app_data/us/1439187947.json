Update 1 - The First of Many<br>I'm thrilled to say that the launch of Rebel Inc. has been a stunning success. Thank you so much for all your support! This update* adds a highly requested feature, some new decisions, and a number of quality of life improvements and bug fixes:<br><br>Fully customisable Operation names<br> - The existing Operation name generator has been enhanced and you can now also name your operation anything you want (we had hundreds of emails asking for this!).<br><br>New decisions and events<br> - e.g. A major international power may decide to initiate a military Surge to help stabilise the region. However, everyone knows the soldiers won't stick around for ever. Maybe you should ask for something else...?<br><br>Fixes and quality of life improvements<br> - Fixed a rare issue where stability would change to NAN (we didn't anticipate players generating so quite so much hostility!)<br> - Fixed issue that sometimes made music volume too low<br> - Fixed rare issue when game would think a cheat was active when it wasn't<br> - Improved button hit-boxes to make them easier to tap on certain devices<br> - Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented achievements from synchronising properly<br> - Fixed various typos, optimised performance and other minor bug fixes<br><br>FYI: we're currently hard at work on the first big content update which will add a new map and governor, language localisation and more!
