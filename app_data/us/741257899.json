There have been many requests to simplify the themes with minimalism, and this has opened up opportunities to make dark and light modes of the app! Revelry in the dark. More colors to come!<br><br>- Quick Action Notifications. When you receive an airing notification, an option will show up to automatically mark the episode as watched. When you reach the last episode, a notification will show up asking you to rate the series. Perfect for if you wanna do a quick action without needing to go into the app!<br><br>- Fine-tuned Appearances. Instead of toggling on contrast and continuity, tweak their percentages to get the perfect balance with your wallpaper. Whether it's not enough contrast or too much blur, you can easily find that sweet spot.<br><br>- Custom app icon. Not a fan of the blue icon? Try vivid orange! Or maybe a sinister red? There's a shiny new app icon that'll fit your style. Got a design idea for an icon? Hit me up on Discord and let's talk!<br><br>I'd love to hear your feedback on new ideas and features you'd love to see in MyAniList. Thank you so much for continuing with me on this journey to making the world's most fun anime and manga tracking app for iOS. I wouldn't be here without y'all's continued support!

Her name is Yuki. She's a reserved 22-year-old girl who loves videogames, lofi beats, and staying indoors so she can code and...well, play videogames. :) Special thanks to nogatsu_ for illustrating her perfectly!
