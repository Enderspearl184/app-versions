I hope you enjoy your break and get some great gifts! (Get a Mac?

Happy New Year, and welcome to the first update of the decade! This update brings a lot!\n\nAlso, since my last update, Apple featured School Assistant in Apps We Love Right Now, so hello to the over 7,000 new users! Also, a huge thanks to Apple for featuring School Assistant! Now, onto the changes:\n \n- Improved Settings layout on Mac and iPad \n- Fixed an issue where the Help section may not have worked properly \n- New Resources tab (more features coming soon)\n- On iPad, the cells in Assignments, etc will no longer look so long on some iPads\n- You can now give your online system a name that will be used across the app in place of “Grades”\n- 10 Schedule days! (By far my most highly requested feature!)\n- Redesigned day selector \n- I noticed that classes could be hard to select sometimes, so I made the cells bigger and more legible \n- Updated Sun Apps branding \n- Updated setup process (although this doesn’t affect you)\n- Updated App Store screenshots"}]
