If you are an avid custom rules creator, you know the struggle of inputting rules one by one.

This is a very big (no pun intended) and important change, which there is surprisingly little to say about. The new size of the application is more than 5 times less than it used to be - ~20Mb instead of ~100Mb. This was achieved strictly by optimization, none of the apps functional was cut. There are literally no drawbacks for the end user.\n\nWe continue to make Adguard more accessible for users all over the world. Some new localizations were added from scratch and others were updated.
