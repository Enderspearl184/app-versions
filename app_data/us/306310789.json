Careful not to tear my tweed jacket in the sharp edges, I climb onto the ledge, pull the window open and hop inside. \nTo my horror, the place has been ransacked. Drawers emptied and left open in their hinges, furniture flipped and torn open, leaving bits of debris floating aimlessly in the air. \n\nAnd pinned against the wall is a hastily-written note: \n\n- Better handling of private messages that are more than 2000 characters\n- Updated visual design of tags in reading lists\n- Improved scrolling performance inside the Home feed\n- If you're a new user, you'll be asked to verify your email before following anyone\n- For storytellers: we've made it easier to view your works as a reader.\n\nThe last thing I see before my vision begins to blurs from panic is a red lipstick stain smeared across a coffee cup left in the sink. It's only one clue, but it's the only one I need to know exactly who is responsible."},{"version_id":"822193683","version_name":"6.31.0","version_date":"2017-05-23 14:08:06.000 +0800","version_description":"It’s a Harry Styles world and we’re all just living in it.\n\n- fixed a terribly annoying crash on app startup\n- sharing user profiles in a Wattpad PM will show a preview of the profile\n- performance improvements to the recommended tags in your library\n- added support for exciting features to be released in the future"},{"version_id":"822193683","version_name":"6.31.0","version_date":"2017-05-23 14:08:06.000 +0800","version_description":"It’s a Harry Styles world and we’re all just living in it.\n\n- fixed a terribly annoying crash on app startup\n- sharing user profiles in a Wattpad PM will show a preview of the profile\n- performance improvements to the recommended tags in your library\n- added support for exciting features to be released in the future"},{"version_id":"822193683","version_name":"6.31.0","version_date":"2017-05-23 14:08:06.000 +0800","version_description":"It’s a Harry Styles world and we’re all just living in it.\n\n- fixed a terribly annoying crash on app startup\n- sharing user profiles in a Wattpad PM will show a preview of the profile\n- performance improvements to the recommended tags in your library\n- added support for exciting features to be released in the future"},{"version_id":"822374965","version_name":"6.32.0","version_date":"2017-06-05 14:47:12.000 +0800","version_description":"We've made it easier for writers to submit their stories for the upcoming Wattys (hold tight and keep your eyes peeled for the official launch coming soon!).

Now, since it is officially Wattys season, we have to find you the perfect outfit . . . to go with this,” Update brings his arms around and presents a red velvet box.

There are templates to suit any genre, tons of free images, and easy customization. This will take stories to the next level.”\n\nI threw the covers off and sat up to grab the steaming mug. I took a long sip of the life-giving brew and asked Update the obvious question, “Can you share and upload straight to Wattpad?”\n\n“Can you ever!” he exclaimed, almost making me choke on my coffee. “And not only that, but you can go back and edit it at any time. You can even use your own images,” he said, nodding at the window scene I was so enamored by,  “so start writing that gritty city thriller, Notesy.”\n\n“Oh Update, you know I’m not much of a wordsmith,” I blushed.\n\nUpdate put his coffee cup down and turned to me, “Maybe not, but that face is worth a thousand words,” he whispered as he drew his arm up to my rosy cheek.\n---"},{"version_id":"829870084","version_name":"7.5.1","version_date":"2019-01-14 00:37:05.000 +0800","version_description":"What’s new:\n- We’ve partnered with a new covers creation app, Desygner, so you can create fun, eye-catching covers that can be uploaded directly to your Wattpad story\n- Readers in the US, Canada, the UK, the Philippines, and Mexico can support writers and unlock supported stories directly on Wattpad\n- Wattpadders can purchase Coins and redeem to read Wattpad Next beta stories\n\n---\nThe rain poured down like a watering can on the city.
