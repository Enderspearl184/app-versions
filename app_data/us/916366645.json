Well, this update is so big it's jumped four versions ahead. Let’s start off with the big news:\n\n• Apple Watch app!\nThe traditional wooden artist’s palette has served painters and illustrators for centuries. This simple tool allowed artists to arrange paint and tools in the artist's hand as they crafted illustrations and fine art.\n\nProcreate Pocket, together with the Apple Watch, reinvents this concept into something new – the digital palette. Reintroducing this centuries-old concept, made fresh by technology, allows us to operate in two distinct modes.\n\n- Swatches \nInspired by the traditional palette, the Swatches mode displays a number of paint ‘wells’ ready for the artist to use. The perfect placement of Apple Watch allows artists to bring digital paint to the canvas by simply touching a color.\n\n- Off-screen tools\nThe Tools mode moves the six essential painting tools from iPhone to Apple Watch. As digital artists crave less interface and more canvas space, Procreate Pocket will animate into a minimalist interface when this mode is active.\n\n- Glance\nTrack how long your masterpieces take to create. This is an ideal feature for time-billing professionals. Simply glance over at your Apple Watch and BOOM! Insta-billable-hours!\n\n- Quick canvas and Clear layer\nForce tapping in any mode will give you the option to quickly create a new doc, right from inside your current work in progress or, clear your current layer. Perfect for quick sketching!\n\n• Swatches\nCreate up to 27 unique swatch colors and group them into three easy to use palettes.\n\n• Improved brush size and opacity sliders\nWe may have gotten a little carried away with the sensitivity of your brush size and opacity sliders. Actually they kind of sucked. So, we made them not suck. With Procreate 1.5 you won’t accidentally keep invoking your brush and opacity sliders. Hurrah for not sucking!\n\n• Rapid mode-swapping \nWe’ve injected serious amounts of speed into process of adding filters, transforming and selecting things. Let’s say you’ve selected part of object and you really need to transform it. Gone is the need to dive through a bunch of menus – now you can just tap the Mode icon at the top to instantly access the advanced menu, ready to jump to any mode you need!\n\nIf you like these free updates, we’d really appreciate if you could let others know, by giving us a quick review on the App Store. Your review will make all the difference!"},{"version_id":"813520443","version_name":"1.5.1","version_date":"2015-09-26 09:05:44.000 +0800","version_description":"iOS 9 is here! Have some fixes. You’ve earned them.\n\n- Multiply blend mode and some Adjustments were very broken. They’re better now.\n- Layers didn’t want to go where you put them, now they do what they’re told.\n- Exporting a PSD file by email will now actually work.\n- We also thought it would be great if the video recording setting actually enabled you to turn video recording on or off. Radical, we know.\n- We fixed an issue where copying a selection while in Transform mode would copy the entire layer instead. \n- Changing your background colour used to also change your selected colour. While this was inclusive and heartwarming, it wasn’t overly practical.\n\nIf you haven’t seen yet, we’ve just made a big announcement - Procreate 3 is coming. This free update for existing users of Procreate for iPad will be our biggest release yet, and it’ll be out by the end of 2015.

Using your finger or any regular capacitive stylus you can adjust the brush size or opacity by adjusting the pressure of your stroke. \n\nThere's also a Shortcut to instantly create a new canvas on 3D Touch devices. Just hold the Procreate Pocket icon on the Home screen and boom.\n\nThere are massive speed improvements of up to double the frame rate across all supported devices. Live fast, die young. Actually, forget about that second part.\n\nThe Apple Watch app is reborn as Procreate Palette. It's also been upgraded to watchOS 2, which greatly improves the battery life and speed of response.\n\nIt's now easier to remove all the evidence with the new two-finger tap to Undo. There's also three-finger tap Redo, and four-finger tap to toggle fullscreen.\n\nOn iPhone 5 and over, Procreate Pocket now uses the full toolbar from Procreate for iPad when in landscape orientation. We love you no matter your orientation.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to have an iPhone with 3D touch you were unlucky enough to be unable to tap or drag layers. Your luck just got better.\n\nTotally and completely, utterly unrelatedly, Alpha Lock is now accessed via the Layer Options menu rather than the swipe gesture. \n\nThere's a bunch of little fixes and tweaks that we'd love to tell you about, but we think your time is better spent checking out Procreate Pocket 1.6 for yourself.

Procreate Pocket is growing up, and shocked to discover it suddenly has Text in places it never had Text before. It's also noticing Liquify, Warp, QuickShape, Crop, Symmetry, Clipping Masks, Drawing Guides, and so much more. \n\n• Text and Typography\nNow that Procreate Pocket has reached textual maturity it's discovered the joy of importing fonts and slipping type into illustrations and designs. With elegant controls and powerful customisation options, your incredibly deep and original song lyrics have never looked better.\n\n• QuickShape\nNo complex menus or tool swapping here: just draw any shape and watch it bend and snap to form flawless squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, and polygons like magic. \n\n• Liquify\nNow you can Pull, Expand, Pinch, and Twirl just the way you like it - but remember to lock your bedroom door first. Exclusive Edge and Crystal brushes add fine control and serendipity to your art, and you can enhance any adjustment with mind-bending Distortion and Momentum.\n\n• Crop & Resize\nCrop & Resize gives you the power to trim down or enlarge your canvas, and you won't even need those dubious emails from your spam folder.\n\n• Advanced Drawing Guides\nStructure your art using new 2D and Isometric Drawing Guides, and snap your strokes to your guide with Drawing Assist. \n\n• Symmetry\nSymmetry Drawing Guides mirror your strokes as you paint. Customize with half, quadrant, or radial options, and use mirror or rotational modes to create mind-blowing kaleidoscopic effects.\n\n• Warp and Distort\nWith up to 16 nodes for fine control, you can wrap, fold, and curve your artwork to fit any angle. \n\n• Improved Selections\nUse new Shape Selections to quickly isolate elliptical or rectangular areas of your artwork. Feather your edges for soft and beautiful blending to take care of those pesky blemishes. \n\n• Improved Inking\nPrecisely adjust the shape and size of your stroke taper: fully customizable pressure curves are now built directly into every brush for size, opacity, and bleed. If only it was always this easy to control your flow.\n\n• Clipping Masks\nClipping Masks let you apply colours, textures, and dazzling effects to any layer. The base layer controls visibility and the clipping mask handles the rest. \n\n• Transform Interpolation\nTake the edge off your transformation results when you choose Bilinear, Bicubic, or Nearest Neighbor. Now you'll never be hard at inappropriate times.\n\n• Gallery Preview \nPinch outward to view your artworks edge to edge, without any distractions. Tap or swipe for a slideshow - but if you swipe too far, you may see things you can’t unsee.\n\n• Share Layers\nExport multiple layers to a PDF, a folder full of PNG images, or express your feelings through the medium of animated GIFs.\n\n• Brush Set Sharing\nNow you can easily archive your brush sets, or share them freely with anyone who catches your eye. \n\n• 30-Second Time Lapse \nExport full length Time-lapses or begin your chosen career as a social media influencer with 30-second recordings. It is too a real job, Mom!\n\n• View Single Layer\nGive a misunderstood layer some alone time by holding the Visibility checkbox. \n\n• QuickMenu\nAccess all your favourite features fast. Activated by double-tap or stylus button, this handy radial menu offers six customizable options.\n\n• Redesigned interface\nKeep the focus on your canvas, with everything you need to refine your illustration close at hand.
