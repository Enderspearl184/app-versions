You want to know whether there’s something better on TV right now, and you think channels are the best way to find out what that is. \n\nSo, lo and behold the feature that is going to make this possible on Hulu:\n\nLive Guide. \n\nSo, what is it exactly?\n\n* Live Guide is a next-generation experience that will help cord-cutters, traditional cable users, and everyone in between find what to watch as quickly as possible. It's slick, without any unnecessary details that would get in the way of your watching experience. \n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Launch Live Guide anytime while watching live TV by holding your phone vertically -- or hitting the exit fullscreen icon (which actually takes you into portrait player).  \n* Live Guide shows a list of all your recently watched channels. Scroll to the right on each of the channel rows to see what’s coming up.   \n* By default, the Live Guide shows your recently watched channels. But you can always select All Channels to see an A-Z list of all channels. \n* With just one click you’ll be able to record any program playing now or in the future \n* (Yes, it’s a TV guide. But way better.) \n* When you're ready to watch, tap your show choice and rotate your device horizontally to watch it full-screen. \n\nNew: So, on this release, we brought you Live Guide, but we also redesigned the way you can look up on-demand content. \n\nHow do you get to it?\n\n* Select any episode of on-demand show \n* Turn your phone vertically to see the guide with the next episodes of that show, content from My Stuff and recommended content.  \n* Turn it back horizontally to watch your program full-screen.  \n\nNew: You were loud and clear on this one. You wanted better ways in which you could tell us what content you REALLY like (and which one you could care less). We made it happen with these two new features:\n\n* Remove from Watch History: Remove items that “mistakenly” ended up on your profile’s Watch History (whether you went to sleep with the TV on and woke up knee-deep into a random season, or your partner was too lazy to switch to their profile and binged like there was no tomorrow). To get rid of shows that you don’t want to watch anymore, select the Remove icon on the Keep Watching Collection. You can also check out all your watching history by scrolling to the bottom of the Keep Watching collection and selecting All Watch History. Then, click on the three dots of every show that you want to remove from that hub. \n\n* Stop suggesting this: You can now improve the quality of in-app recommendations by down-voting shows that don’t apply to you. If you see suggestions in your lineup that you don’t like, tap on the Stop Suggesting button to make them go away forevah. Access this feature via the context menu on recommended collections (Lineup, News, TV, Movies, and Kids) on the Home screen. \n\nNew: Hold your horses. We have ANOTHER update. And this is a big one for a lot of you. We brought back HDMI support! Use your iOS device to connect to an external display with an HDMI Lightning adapter. (Apple approved Lightning-to-HDMI adapters highly recommended).\n\nNew: And last but not least… the Chromecast controller is now your remote of the future! It looks better, feels better and does more for you."},{"version_id":"827269236","version_name":"5.23.1","version_date":"2018-05-25 06:01:42.000 +0800","version_description":"New: Find all your live TV in one place.
