We’re still developing the feature, but at this point documents load much faster, all at the same time and in the correct order according to the sorting. For you it will result in a smoother loading experience. Yay!<br><br>## Improved Drag &amp; Drop<br>You also have reported difficulty with DnD on 3D Touch devices since iOS 13. We tested and discovered that 3D Touch is somehow conflicting with the DnD on the aforementioned devices, we fixed that. For you it will result in a smoother Drag and Drop experience. <br><br>## “Select All’ function<br>Another long-term ask from our users, who want to easily select all documents to share or delete them. We’ve added this simple button so that you can go into Select mode on your homepage.<br><br>And here are some features outside of homepage:<br><br>* Improved Pages Management<br>Pages Management hides behind the ‘4 squares’ icon in Scanner and affords you to copy, move or delete pages in a document. We’ve added navigation mode to help users go to the needed page of a multi-page document. <br><br>* Flashlight instead of Flash on camera<br>When it comes to scanning on your phone in low light, the options are kind of terrible: a super bright flash whitens documents and without it documents end up blurry or grainy. Using the flashlight it will yield more control (since you can play around with the angle at which the light falls on the document) and better results (better border detection, less additional shadows from the burst of flash light).<br><br>We hope, you love this update as much as we do. <br>If you need us you can find us at rdsupport@readdle.com<br>Just pop on over to our Support Team and they'll point you in the right direction."}]
