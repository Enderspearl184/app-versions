And you want to hang out with them. They're good peoples.\n• The Outlet: we made that shopping experience jazzier and snazzier so make sure to check it out. Believe me. Jazzy and snazzy are not words I throw around a lot.\n• Bug swatting: Those pesky ol' bugs have a tendency to keep on popping up but luckily we've got the most advanced bug swatting team on the market.
