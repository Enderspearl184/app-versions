Tempo enables all walks when no running workouts are found on first launch. With this fix, Tempo will not re-enable all walks after initial install/launch cycle. You can always enable all walks option from the Settings screen.<br><br>- Pause Detection: This was an interesting bug. Long story short, before this release, if you paused in the midst of a run, Tempo did not detect pauses, causing split’s average pace to be much higher than it would be without the paused time interval. With this release, Tempo will detect and show paused times in seconds for the respective splits.<br><br>My sincere thanks to our awesome runners, who reported the above issues.<br><br>One more update for our new users - with this release Tempo is free to install from the App Store. Tempo 2.0 will introduce a subscription model. All of you, who paid for Tempo on launch, will have access to all the advanced features at no additional cost i.e. requiring no subscription for the first 2 years. For the new users, I have added a patronage option as an in-app purchase, so you can also lower your cost to access advanced features and save on upcoming 2.0 subscription cost. You can read more on patronage and subscription under the info section of the app or on Indie's blog - http://indie.sh/blog/2016/9/3/freemium-patronage-subscription<br><br>As always, please e-mail me at tempo@indie.sh or say hi on twitter @TempoLog with your stories, feedback or questions.<br><br>Finally, if you are finding Tempo useful, please rate it in the App Store.
