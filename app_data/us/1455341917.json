from the ground up to make it even easier for you to unlock the full power of your crypto. <br><br>Here’s what’s new:<br><br>→ We've cleaned up the dashboard and the onboarding experience to show you our most popular features and make you feel at home even quicker.<br>→ You now have the option to hide all zero balances within the Wallet tab – turn this ‘on’ for a tidier look.<br>→ Because privacy is precious, there’s a new privacy setting, too – we’ve added the option to hide your balances from prying eyes. <br>→ We’ve simplified the Exchange experience within the app – there are now separate UX flows for buying, selling, and swapping your assets.<br>→ You can flip the rate between market pairs to see how cryptocurrency prices compare to each other. <br><br>Overall, this major revamp moves our app to a new codebase that’s more stable, allowing us to fix bugs more quickly and release new features on a more regular basis.<br><br>The Nexo Wallet App 2.0 is just the beginning – we’ve already got some exciting things in the pipeline.
