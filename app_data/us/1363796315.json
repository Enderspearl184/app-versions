Introducing Exceptions; a powerful feature we are proud to bring to the Guardian Firewall experience. \n\nIf you are enjoying Guardian Firewall + VPN, we’d like to encourage you to rate or review our app in the App Store.\n\nExceptions: This feature provides even more configuration of our Firewall + VPN service to cater to your specific needs. Can’t re-watch Mandalorian episodes because Disney + doesn’t play well with Guardian? Now, with exceptions, you can! \n\nThe Exceptions feature was created to allow users to precisely define what traffic should be excluded from being filtered by our firewall servers while still providing firewall and VPN protection to all other traffic. If you have noticed a website or application on your iOS device is acting up or simply won't load while Guardian is connected, this new feature solves this issue by allowing you to simply add the website URL or application to the Exceptions list. Once added, these specific apps or websites will be excluded from being routed through our firewall to create an uninterrupted experience all while continuing to protect and filter all other traffic as you use your device.\n\nEnter any hostname you wish to exclude or search for the name of an iOS app in our database with over 14,000 analyzed applications. Our app database continues to be regularly updated to ensure the best possible compatibility.\n\nFor Pro users, we have completely overhauled the interface to generate additional VPN credentials, and added more sharing capability to share VPN credentials to other mobile OS using a .sswan StrongSwan compatible file.\n\nThis update also includes the ability to reset the Alerts menu counts to zero.

We continue to deploy new servers for you around the world in new and existing regions to provide the best possible connection to as many people as possible.\n\n\nAfter some very helpful reports from a few users with lots of screenshots we were able to hunt down a state disconnect in the Exceptions feature. Sometimes it would be off when it shouldn't be and sometimes it would end up being enabled when it shouldn't be, but no more! Once enabled, the Exceptions feature should now be turned on and off with the VPN connection automatically. If the VPN connection to our secure nodes is enabled and you setup Exceptions for your device, the feature should always be enabled, unless manually disabled of course.\n\nWe added a new feature for our Pro users that subscribed via the in-app purchase to cross authenticate in our new Mac app. Instead of copying a long scrambled piece of text into the Mac app you now only have to tap the button \"Generate macOS Access Code\" in Guardian Settings > Advanced and then type the 6 character string into our app on your Mac.

We continue to deploy new servers for you around the world to provide the best possible quality of service to as many subscribers as possible.\n\nNEW: Access to Experimental Features - Pro subscribers may now access upcoming features prior to general availability. We have added a new experimental toggle to the Advanced menu of Guardian’s in-app Settings (Tap the Gear icon in the top right to access). By enabling the option, your device will connect to Guardian gateways running updated revisions of our infrastructure software. All existing features should always work and continue to be reliable, but optimizations may be completed server side to enable early access to new features. We are currently working on many feature additions to our cloud firewall and hope to roll these out to our Pro customers frequently.\n\nNEW: Bypass Firewall Rules - The first addition of new features for Pro subscribers, Bypass Firewall Rules, can be found in the Advanced menu of Guardian’s in-app Settings. Enabling this feature will route your connection through Guardian’s secure tunnel, without enforcement of our standard firewall rule sets. This can be useful when accessing apps and websites which do not function properly if tracking/advertising software is blocked. \nTo enable this capability please navigate into Guardian Settings > Advanced > Enable Experimental Features (Pro Only) and then enable Bypass Firewall Rules.\n\nENHANCEMENT: To continue improving our support team’s ability to resolve issues for users, we have introduced a persistent log feature. No personally identifiable information is ever logged, nor do the contents of the log ever leave your device unless specifically enabled in our Contact Technical Support form. The log is never longer than 200 lines to be respectful of your device's disk space and always stored in plain text to be easily accessible and reviewable by any customer. \nIt is recommended to keep this setting enabled, but we understand and respect if some customers prefer to disable it. If you prefer to disable it, please navigate to Guardian Settings > Advanced and disable Persistent Debug Logs in the Local Data Management section.\n\nWe also resolved a few minor bugs, including a bug which would immediately ask to setup the Guardian Configuration VPN profile after initially downloading and opening the app. Fully resolved, the tunnel configuration is only installed if the Exceptions feature is enabled. We sincerely apologize to any new users who encountered this bug.\n\nThank you very much for your feedback and sustained support. It means the world to our little team!"},{"version_id":"845385288","version_name":"2.2.6","version_date":"2021-11-30 01:15:22.000 +0800","version_description":"We are pleased to introduce new features in this minor update to Guardian Firewall + VPN. \n\nIf you are enjoying Guardian Firewall + VPN, we’d like to encourage you to rate or review our app in the App Store.
