They refresh location on display, but that is it.<br>- Location \"always\" mode is now only requested when you enable an alert. Why is \"always\" mode requested? Sundial works best when it can get your up-to-date location if you travel far enough to change solar/lunar times. But this is optional and if not enabled, the last cached location is used when scheduling alerts in the background.<br>- Location \"always\" mode now uses geofencing to be notified of a location move greater than 5 miles or 8 kilometers from last location. This may result in even less battery usage (which is already &lt;1%).
