No more reason to break your thumb by switching from Zenly to another messaging app. Stay in the app and make your plans directly from there. Spice up your poetry with our crazy emojis and make ‘em sing (tip: turn your sound on and make some noiiiiiiiiiiise!)\n\n***Embrace your profile***\nYou now have a real Zenly profile (so do your friends) and you can see how many times you’ve been watched on any given day. Maybe you’ll even discover some easter eggs… \nChatting with your friends’ friends is now possible.
