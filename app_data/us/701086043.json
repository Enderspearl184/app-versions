These cameras do not fully support v.2.1 of the Open Spherical Camera (OSC) spec and are unsupported.<br><br>Capture 3.0.x summary:<br>• Matterport Capture now runs on iPhones as well as iPads! <br>• 360 camera support: use your Insta360 ONE X or Ricoh Theta Z1 or V to create immersive 3D spaces using our Cortex AI technology. <br>• Continue creating immersive 3D spaces using the Matterport Pro2, Pro2 Lite, Pro 3D and Leica BLK360 cameras.<br>• Experimental: convert placed 360 Views to 3D and align them into the 3D model using our Cortex AI.<br><br>Requirements:<br>• You *must* be signed in to your Matterport account to enable Theta Z1, Theta V or ONE X compatibility (requires an additional download).<br>• Insta360 ONE X: you *must* be running production firmware 1.18.16 or higher. Use the ONE X app or download from www.insta360.com/download/insta360-onex to update.<br><br>iOS Device Limitations:<br>• We support all iOS devices that can upgrade to iOS 12. <br>• Older iOS devices with only 1GB of RAM (iPad Air, mini 2, mini 3; iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5S; iPod Touch (6th)) are best with a Matterport Pro (1st Gen) 3D Camera.

Sometimes this was preceded by or followed by a crash.  [Issue #2 at the link below]<br>• Fixed:  the 'minimap' (the 2D top-down preview of the scans) is blank after opening a scan job, sometimes with a message that says 'updating map'. In this new version, we will inspect every scan and update it if necessary the first time a job is opened. This only needs to happen once per scan job. For very large jobs it may take several minutes to check everything. You can dismiss this inspection if inconvenient, but the next time you open the scan job it will start again until completed. This step is focused on what you see within Capture; it does not alter the underlying scan data and does NOT need or imply the need to upload again.  [Issue #3 at the link below]<br>• Fixed: 'spray' or 'scratches' appear on previously scanned areas of the minimap (e.g. black pixels).  [Issue #4 at the link below]<br>• Fixed: blurry sections of an iPhone or iPad Capture that appear as if one or more shots in the rotation were missed.
