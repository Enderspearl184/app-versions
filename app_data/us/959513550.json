To celebrate, Bus++ has gotten a pretty big facelift and a couple of new features. <br><br>- Cleaned up design:  A bunch of the distracting fluff has been removed and the important stuff has gotten brighter and bolder.  Hopefully the app should be generally clearer and a little less odd. <br><br>- iOS 10 Widget:  The today widget has been redesigned to be an iOS 10 friendly widget.  You can still find the widget on your Today view but you also now see the arrivals for your nearest stop by force touching the Bus++ app icon. <br><br>- Stop Switcher:  For users with many favourites swiping through pages and pages of stops to get to the one you need can be tiresome.  To help with this you can now tap the dots at the bottom of the screen to bring up the Stop Switcher and quickly jump to any of your favourites. <br><br>Thanks to everyone for putting up with Bus++, especially those who wrote in through the app's feedback feature.
