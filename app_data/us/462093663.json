In this release we have addressed some of the issues, and we're still working on some others for future releases.

This makes it easier to browse all channels and then select to Watch Live, or set Recordings and Series Tags.\n- Everything you could do from the Control menu in the previous app version, you can now do from the TV Guide. The Remote Control is activated directly from the top left of the TV Guide, and the Channel Changer is accessed by swiping left on the remote.\n- We've added a play symbol in the logo box for channels you are subscribed to, making it easier to see what you can watch live on the app. At this stage you still need to add new pack subscriptions via your box.\n- We've also added large images that display when you select a show from the TV Guide, helping make it easier to recognise and select shows.\n\nTV Menu:\n- In the TV section we've increased visibility of the channels you already have access to in your pack subscriptions, helping you to decide what to watch live right now. You can still access the paid TV Store content from here, it's just moved further down.\n- You can now also watch catch-up episodes from a selection of the channels included in your subscription packs. We've not yet been able to provide access to recordings, but the addition of catch-up does give you more on demand TV options.\n\nOther changes:\n- We've updated our logo.\n- Tweaks to further improve speed, performance and stability.\n- The usual general bug fixes."},{"version_id":"821571769","version_name":"3.51","version_date":"2017-04-05 08:09:51.000 +0800","version_description":"Thanks to everyone who gave us feedback on the last app update - we heard you!
