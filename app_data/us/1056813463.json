Check out the newly redesigned Dunkin’ Donuts Mobile App!  <br><br>From first launching the Dunkin’ Donuts Mobile App in 2012, introducing our DD Perks® Rewards Program in 2014 and then adding On-the-Go Mobile Ordering in 2016, we are constantly innovating to make it easier than ever to run on Dunkin’. Just like all of our digital innovations, our latest Dunkin’ Donuts Mobile App was built with our consumers in mind. <br><br>We know our busy, On-The-Go guests want to grab their Dunkin’ run and go, so we simplified our home screen. Now, guests can order their favorites or pay for their order right when they open the app with just a touch of a button and no scrolling required.   <br><br>We’ve also heard from our guests that they want greater ability to customize their Mobile Orders, just like they would in-store. That’s why we’ve enhanced our On-the-Go menu, allowing guests to choose how much ice they’d like in their iced beverages, options for half decaf coffee and more. <br><br>Our DDPerks Rewards page also got a refresh, making it easier than ever for DDPerks Members to check how many points they’ve earned towards a free beverage and redeem their rewards. With DDPerks, guests earn five points for every dollar they spend at Dunkin’ Donuts when they pay using an enrolled DD Card. Once a member accrues 200 points, the guest receives a coupon for a free beverage of their choice right on the Dunkin’ Donuts Mobile App. Learn more at DDPerks.com.<br><br>The newly redesigned Dunkin’ Mobile App also allows guests to find Dunkin’ Donuts locations, send Gift Cards, find nutritional info and more. If you haven’t already, be sure to download the Dunkin’ Donuts Mobile App and enroll in DD Perks today. <br><br>How do you like our new, lighter Dunkin’ Mobile App?
