Leprechauns, Fairies, Druids and more!<br><br>Last updates Time Attack mode now lets you earn coins so you can play either mode to unlock new characters, backgrounds and spells! We also fixed the bug in this mode that caused it to crash if you gained more than 60 seconds time...sorry about that!<br><br>Arcade mode now has three distinct new settings:<br><br>Classic - The mode you all know and love.<br>Zen - A less stress inducing version of the game. We have removed some of the more stressful elements like dark knights (no more pesky hard to draw purple balloon shapes), thieves and stored spells. We reduced some of the balloon numbers too and the game does not speed up. Time for a new high score!<br>Insane - This mode take the difficulty and turns it up to 11 starting the game at a much accelerated pace. We removed all things that slowed the pace of the game like chests and now the only spells are the ones you use strategically from books! The big addition however is that there are now extra balloon shapes for both the regular knights and the dark knights. This mode is not for the faint hearted!<br><br>All the new game modes have their own high score tables so get your fingers ready to take on your friends once again!"},{"version_id":"818836551","version_name":"1.9","version_date":"","version_description":""},{"version_id":"823689681","version_name":"1.9.1","version_date":"","version_description":""},{"version_id":"823689681","version_name":"0.9","version_date":"2017-09-18 21:40:32.000 +0800","version_description":"Bug fixes and improvements for a more enjoyable experience!"},{"version_id":"834724090","version_name":"2","version_date":"","version_description":""},{"version_id":"835976618","version_name":"2.1.0","version_date":"2020-05-18 08:45:48.000 +0800","version_description":"Bug fixes and improvements for a more enjoyable experience!"}]
