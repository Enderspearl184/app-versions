Easily calculate the shooting distance for a specific Sun/Moon size compared to a subject. The Planner will draw a circumference around the Black Pin showing the distance you have to place the Red Pin to get the size of the Sun/Moon you want. You can enable this tool from the Map Settings button, located on the map, next to the (+) button.<br><br>- Added an option to manually set the altitude for the Red and Black Pins. In the Planner, tap More &gt; Altitudes to manually set the altitudes.<br><br>- When you do a long press on the center of the time bar, now it spans 15 minutes instead of 1 hour. This way you can change the time more slowly to better align the Sun, the Moon or the Milky Way.<br><br>- Added the option to use real Sun and Moon azimuth lines on the map, taking into account Earth curvature (enabled by default). Now PhotoPills will be more accurate for really long distance shots. You can switch this option off/on from the Sun/Moon layers you'll find in the Map settings button, on the map, next to the (+) button.<br><br>- Latitude and Longitude coordinates now show 6 decimal places instead of 4.<br><br>- In the Find &gt; Sun or Find &gt; Moon tools, now the apparent height shown in the Elevation tab (Numeric bottom option) is referred to the Yellow/Blue Pin terrain instead of Red Pin terrain. This way you don't have to do any mental calculation when planning the Sun/Moon at certain height above the ground level of your subject.<br><br>- New cameras: Canon EOS RP; Film camera 24x65 XPan, Medium Format 5x12, 6x10, 6x12, 6x17, 6x24, 6x7, 6x8; Fujifilm FinePix XP140, X-T30; GoPro HERO7; Leica D-Lux 7, M10-D, Q-P, Q2; Nikon Coolpix A1000, Coolpix B600, Coolpix L830, Coolpix P600; Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ1000 II, Lumix DC-S1, Lumix DC-S1R, Lumix DC-ZS80 (DC-TZ95); Ricoh G900, WG-6; Sony a6400; Xiaomi YI 4K.<br><br>- Bug fixes<br><br>Please, If you find a bug (or have a suggestion), send us an email to info@photopills.com and we'll fix it as soon as possible :)"},{"version_id":"831187926","version_name":"2.10.2","version_date":"2019-05-06 06:53:57.000 +0800","version_description":"- Bug fixes<br><br>Version 2.10<br>--------------<br>We've improved the Planner:<br>- Updated the 2nd top panel of the Planner. Now it also shows the apparent height of the Sun, Moon, Milky Way arch or Galactic Center above the Black Pin terrain. Do you want to plan a Moon shot over a 20m bulding? Place the Black Pin on the building and move the time and the Red Pin so when the Moon is aligned with the Black Pin, this 2nd top panel says the moon is at 20m. This panel also shows the size (in meters or feet) that the Moon or Sun will have in the Black Pin position.
