This means that it doesn't need to be connected to your phone to work.<br>- Home Screen Quick Action shortcuts are now available if you have a 3D Touch screen (iPhone 6S and above). Just press down hard on the Remote S icon on the Home Screen to access a quick 3D Touch menu.<br>- Added an MPH/KPH usage stat above the \"Usage (kW)\" stat. This will tell you at what rate your car is draining energy. Now you'll know how many miles/kilometers of range you'll lose per hour when you turn on the climate control. It's also useful to see how many mi/km of range you're losing from the way you're driving.<br>- Added new charging stats: Instant Rate (mph/kph) and Instant Power (kW). The mph/kph charging rate that Tesla displays when using a Supercharger is an average rate over the entire charge. Now you can get the instantaneous charging rate to know how fast you're actually charging at that moment. No more guessing how long it'll take to charge from 98% to 99%.<br>- The firmware version of your car displays briefly whenever the stats are updating. Now, you'll know which firmware version you updated to without having to go into your car to check.<br>- Added setting \"Disconnect from Watch app\". This allows you to log into the Watch app as one Tesla and control another Tesla with your phone. Otherwise the Watch will control the same car that the phone does and also signs off when the Phone app signs off.<br>- Added URL Schema support. Launch Remote S with commands by simply putting the command after the remotes:// URL. For example if you put remotes://horn as the URL in Safari, the horn will honk. To set the temperature, use remotes://temp?21 (degrees are in Celsius). If you want to set the passenger temperature separately, use remotes://temp?21&amp;23 (where the second number is the passenger temperature). Here are some more examples of functions: light, port, port?close, valet?on, valetoff, autoparkpause, autoparkforward, autoparkreverse, homelink, roof?80 (where 80 is a percentage of the roof open), hvac, hvac?on, hvacoff, lock, unlock, start, start?password (where password would be your MyTesla password to skip TouchID), limit?90 (sets the charge limit to 90%), charge, and charge?off. So to do something like set the roof to 50% open, you'd go to remotes://roof?50. With this URL schema, you can create a website that redirects you to the URL, and put that bookmark on your Home Screen. As an example, going to regoapps.com/unlock on your phone will unlock your car. Or you could have a website that links to all your favorite commands and temperature/charge presets.
