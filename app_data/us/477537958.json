We heard feedback that this wasn't always clear, so we added a new context menu next to each item.

The new Home tab prominently features your Recent view for easy access to your files and an Offline Files section to quickly access and manage files you’ve downloaded for offline access.  \n∙ For OneDrive personal users, On This Day is now featured at the top of your new Home tab.\n∙ For users of OneDrive at work or school, you can easily get to your Shared Libraries right from the Home tab.\n\nWe’re thrilled to offer iOS 14 users a OneDrive widget.

We’ve heard your feedback and we’re investing in this experience.

This has been fixed.\n∙ We updated our folder iconography to better highlight shared status in list and grid view. This also comes with subtle improvements to some Office file type icons in the app.  \n∙ We’ve added Scribble support, allowing users to write in any text field, including PDF annotation mode, so your writing will automatically be converted to typed text.\n∙ Our loading screens now shimmer with a little more predictability and pizazz than they did before.  \n∙ We fixed a visual bug with where the + button wasn’t showing with the right colors in Dark Mode. \n∙ We fixed an issue with our accessibility label for InputTextField so this can be read properly by VoiceOver. \n∙ We updated our logic for calculating when you might be in a meeting to optimize our “Meeting Note Share” feature which enables you to easily share your scans taken during a meeting with other attendees. \n∙ We fixed a crash in our app that sometimes occurred when attempting to take a scan. \n\n\nThis wouldn't be possible without your feedback.
