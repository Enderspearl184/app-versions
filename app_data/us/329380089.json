Little Green Men, iPad, prompts, Bitcode, and analytics: It's been a busy week!<br><br>Zeroth, since I failed to mention this in my last release notes, you may notice a new green bar with a little dude on stop pages. This bar shows you vehicles that you can catch by walking. Vehicles above the line probably cannot be caught, and vehicles below should depart long enough from now that you can walk to them. <br><br>First up, OneBusAway now works on the iPad! Hooray! I was skeptical of the value of doing this work at first, but with the addition of split screen mode on the iPad in iOS 9, I think this becomes far more useful. Plus, all of the work we've done to improve how the app's UI is laid out over the past year made this a trivial task.<br><br>Second, you can now disable those prompts that ask you to review the app. Check out the settings page under the Info tab. Thanks for doing this work, Alan.<br><br>Third, speaking of settings, when you opt out of Google Analytics, that setting now takes effect immediately as opposed to the next time you start the app.<br><br>Fourth, we've added support for Apple's Bitcode feature, which should allow Apple to further optimize the version of the app that is delivered to your device, and hopefully even shrink it down a bit more. Thanks for your help on this, Seth!<br><br>Lastly, OneBusAway for iOS is an all-volunteer effort. If you'd like to pitch in, please come find us on GitHub.
