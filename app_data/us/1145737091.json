So don’t worry.<br>- When you find something you love in an artist's shop, you’ll find more somethings to love thanks to the “More Like This” panel. Which is very nice. Because the world could always use more love, right? Awwwww.<br><br>- Remember what we said about the “sharp” artist profiles like, two seconds ago? Well, the same could be said for delivery dates. Because we made those look better too. So please refer to that update, but exchange “artist profiles” for “delivery dates” and you'll be sufficiently updated. Thanks for not making us type that again.<br><br>- Plus, we squashed some bugs. Bugs are dumb.
