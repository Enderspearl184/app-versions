As this is another update, could you please quickly post them again? That way they show up for the latest version which really helps with visibility on the App Store. Thanks a ton!<br><br>We have a few bug fixes for version 3.8 in this update:<br><br>Bugfix: The system keyboard shows up again in the 'Tools' menu of the iPhone version. Protip: You can show that keyboard more quickly by just swiping up with one finger on the PocketCAS keyboard.<br>Bugfix: Fixed the cursor jumping when typing at the beginning of very long entries.<br>Bugfix: Fixed a crash when deleting the \"X/Y Precision\" fields in the 3D plot settings.<br><br>Also, we have two responses to reviews for version 3.8. We can't respond to reviews directly, so we will post them here:<br>1. PocketCAS does _not_ require iCloud. You can use the app just fine without it. Only two minor features that are most useful to power users (subfolders and CSV import) who would probably enable iCloud anyway require it.<br>2. About \"New Entry\" mode being like writing a script: You can just enter a single line, press 'Calculate' and get the answer. How is this different from other CAS calculators? If you want an answer for other calculations, just create another new entry and calculate that separately - again, just like in other CAS calculators.
