Much of the work in today's update was focused on internal stability and improvements; a deep dive into the internals of the app to shore up its foundation. <br><br>One of the biggest changes we made is one that you should actually never notice. Next month Dropbox is going to be completing a year-long project to close down its existing application programming interface - the thing that allows 1Password to sync your information via Dropbox - in favor of a brand new one. We’ve had the pleasure of working with the folks at Dropbox to make this transition as seamless as possible for you. When Dropbox turns out the lights on its old API next month 1Password will roll on as if nothing has changed.<br><br>Beyond the under-the-hood improvements we’ve added one particularly exciting feature for our 1Password.com account holders. The next time you set up 1Password on a new device you will be able to breeze right through setup with nothing but your Master Password.

Today we are pleased to bring you 1Password 6.9: The iOS 11 Edition. With today's update 1Password is ready and raring to go on the latest and greatest that Apple has to offer. Now before we go much farther I want to set your mind at ease: you are not going to find a bunch of \"this one goes to 11\" puns and references in the release notes below. We could have, and we considered it, but we didn't. You're welcome. :) <br><br>What we did do instead was bring an incredible feature from iOS 11 on iPad and made it right at home in 1Password.

Simply pull up 1Password side-by-side with another app, find the Login for that app in 1Password, and then drag and drop your username and password right into the login fields. And it's not just usernames and passwords, either. You can drag and drop any field from any item. It's simple and it's simply amazing.<br><br># Contacts, Meet Identities<br><br>One of the most powerful features of 1Password is its ability to fill your name and mailing address into an web page (when you're shopping online, for instance). With drag and drop it's never been easier to get your personal information into 1Password. Just drag your contact card from Contacts and drop it into 1Password. All of your information will be imported into a shiny new 1Password Identity, ready to be filled into your browser at a moment's notice.<br><br># Add Any Information From Anywhere<br><br>Have a crucial piece of information you want to store in 1Password?

No waiting, no delays; just instant, secure access to your private information.<br><br>## All About The Speed<br><br>When we started planning 1Password 7 we had one overarching goal in mind: take the ways people use 1Password today and make those workflows sing. The first place we did so was with our new Quick Copy feature. One of the most common uses for 1Password is to copy and paste your username and password into another app when you need to log in. With Quick Copy, 1Password knows when you've copied your username so that on your next trip back from pasting that username it puts your password on the clipboard for you automatically. If you're using 1Password for your two-factor verification codes it will copy that for you on the next return as well.<br><br>## Unlocking the Power Of Your Keyboard<br><br>For some of us, we're never more productive than when our hands stay locked on the keyboard. Taking a cue from our big sibling on macOS, we've now brought over a bevy of beautiful keyboard shortcuts to 1Password for iOS. Searching, switching tabs, and open and filling items in the browser can now be done with the stroke of a key.<br><br>## Much, Much More<br><br>Yes, we've brought some big ticket changes to 1Password, but many of the little things add up as well. 1Password now unlocks 33% faster and has seen a 400% increase in stability throughout. You can now select and delete multiple items at a time. Our password generator is smoother, more responsive, and easier to use.

A small glitch in our build pipeline caused us to release a version of 7.0.2 yesterday that didn't contain all of the fixes our release notes were promising. We apologize for the back-to-back update. Rest assured 7.0.3 is the real deal. Please enjoy the following encore presentation of our original 7.0.2 release notes:<br><br>We started this week with a solid update to 1Password 7, and we decided to end the week with one as well. Turns out there were a couple more bugs that needed squashing, so we got out the tennis rackets and got to work. Thank you to everyone who reached out with feedback both positive and constructive. We appreciate it!<br><br>## Fixed<br><br>• Fixed an issue where tapping on the row for the “Welcome!” walkthrough video wouldn't actually play the video. {OPI-4311}<br>• One-Time Password fields are now properly localized in Favorites.<br>• Spaces are removed from credit card numbers during Drag and Drop. {OPI-4205}<br>• Fixed an issue where Command + F wouldn't activate search on the Favorites tab. {OPI-4265}<br>• Some text in the item lists and on the lock screen was incorrectly aligned for RtL languages. {OPI-4299}<br>• Fixed an issue where the ‘reveal password’ client setting was not properly respected in certain cases. {OPI-4313}<br><br><br>1Password never prompts you for a review because we value your workflow too much to interrupt it.

Today’s update is all about bringing a little more feature parity between 1Password for Mac and 1Password for iOS. Starting today you’ll be able to access (and empty) the trash as well as organize your items better using nested tags. We’ve also added a whole new collection of stickers to our sticker pack, just for fun.<br><br>## Trash<br><br>If you ever take the time to look back through the myriad release notes from 1Password updates of the past you’ll start to see a theme: us thanking you for your input and for helping us make 1Password better. This isn’t a throwaway line, it’s a guiding principle we use as we tackle new features, improvements, and bug fixes. The addition of trash in 1Password for iOS is the latest example of your feedback directly driving a change. Trash has been a feature that’s been baked into 1Password for quite some time. Up until recently, though, we haven’t distinguished between deleting an item and sending it to the trash. Starting today you can move items to the trash, bring them back, or get rid of them for good by emptying the trash. <br><br>Thank you to everyone who got in touch and let us know this feature was important to them. We really appreciate it.<br><br>## Tags<br><br>When 1Password 7 for Mac was released last year we added a cool upgrade to our tags feature: nested tags. We’ve now brought full support for nested tags to iOS.  Nested tags allow you to up your organization: simply type a forward slash (/) when entering a tag to break it up into nested groups. Typing A/B/C will give you tag C inside B, and B inside A.<br><br>## Stickers<br><br>One of the great things about working at 1Password is getting to work alongside incredibly talented, creative folks every day. One of the great things about talented, creative folks is that they love to, well, create! When our design team came to the developers and said, “We've got a whole bunch of new stickers for our sticker app” we were more than happy to oblige.
