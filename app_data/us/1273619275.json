We have an updated Project in DreamLab:<br><br>Welcome into the Phase 2 of this large multiphase scientific project called DRUGS (for \"Drugs Repurposing Using Grids of Smartphones\") &nbsp;which aims to determine how different cancer types can be treated with existing drugs or their combinations. Thanks to your contribution, this speeds up the drug discovery process by re-purposing drugs, therefore providing more effective anti-cancer treatments, quicker. Using your phone's processing power and an algorithm contained within the app, when you power DreamLab you will calculate how different drugs and new combinations of drugs can be used as a treatment for different cancer types based on genetic data from cancer patients. DreamLab provides the computing power needed to determine how different genetic mutations affect the drug outcomes.<br><br>As always, when it comes to the search for a better anti-cancer treatment, no \"fast\" is ever fast enough, thus we are aiming to speed up research even further with the results already obtained, thanks to your effort and support of DreamLab and DRUGS project. We have already processed the partial results obtained so far from the Phase 1 of this project and started a faster Phase 2 to focus on genetically tailored individual drug recommendations, to be followed soon by the more complex Phase 3 and Phase 4 on combinatorial treatment possibilities.<br><br>Please support the new phases of the project as they become available and this new Phase 2 especially! We need you! Thanks to your help and contribution we can help beat cancer faster and more effectively! Let's not just dream about the World without cancer, but #SleepLikeAHero to actually help it happen!"},{"version_id":"828656087","version_name":"1.2.3","version_date":"2018-09-24 01:47:57.000 +0800","version_description":"Attention Dreamers!
