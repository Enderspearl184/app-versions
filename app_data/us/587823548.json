Original release notes for version 1.70000 are below:<br><br>Hold on to your butts! This is a pretty hefty update. First and foremost we've fixed a bunch of bugs for all of you intrepid iOS 11 folks. Thanks for bearing with us. We also added new journal editor when you tap into a day (we called this the diary before but it's the same deal).<br><br>One change to note is that we are doing some housekeeping and no longer show mashed movies in 1SE. But fear not! They are always available in the 1SE album in your Photos app, where you have access to more editing and sharing features.<br><br>** NEW **<br><br>• Added new mashing presets so you can easily mash a season. When you tap the play button to mash a video choose Presets on the left, then tap Seasons in the middle, and pick a season on the right.<br><br>• There's a way to automatically fill in all of the visible the orange days in your timeline! Tap the purple magic wand button next to the mash button in the bottom right corner. You can choose to keep or discard the generate snippets so there's no risk, and you can try it again to get different choices. This is really cool and we think you'll like it a lot. (If you already found this by shaking your phone, thanks for helping us test it out)<br><br>• You can choose to automatically add location names to new snippets for each project instead of it being all-or-nothing. The default setting is still the same where you get locations in freestyle projects, and don't get them in timelines. Go into the project list and hit the little edit pencil icon by a project title to change this option for existing projects.<br><br><br>** IMPROVED **<br><br>• When you're recording a snippet with 1SE and leave the app or get interrupted by, say, a phone call, your video is saved to your photo library immediately so it doesn't get lost.<br><br>• Save looping snippet videos to your photo library with one tap.<br><br>• Added a button to share mashed movies with Messages.<br><br>• If you select a lot of snippets really fast in a row you may have seen the mysterious message \"Unknown error 6: Cannot Decode\", or other weird things happen. Now things should work more smoothly, you just may have to be a bit patient and wait for your phone to catch up if you go really fast. We recommend getting a nice beverage and taking a few more seconds to choose your hand-crafted, artisanal, gluten-free snippets. But if you want to speed through it that should be better now. (Hi Dave!)<br><br>• The scroll, the scroll, the buttons, the buttons. Scrollin' so smooth like the butter on a muffin.<br><br><br>** FIXED **<br><br>• Recorded videos work properly when your phone is locked in portrait orientation on iOS 11.<br><br>• Mashed movies had some problems with audio going out of sync when shared to Facebook, and video corruption when sent to a Mac or PC and opened in VLC and other video apps. Thankfully this should no longer be the case. Share my friends, share!<br><br>• A few of you had thumbnails disappear. They should reappear in this version, and we regret the error. Those responsible have been sacked.

Mark your snippets as private so that they're excluded from your mashed movies unless you explicitly include them. This makes it easy to include private moments in your timeline that you may not want to mash and share with others.<br><br>• New custom mashing! There's now a totally new way to make mashes even more customizable. You can select and deselect months at a time, and you can even tap on individual snippets to include or exclude them! Combined with private snippets, it's easier and faster than ever to mash specific movies, like someone's birthday over the years or all the snippets with your dog from the last few weeks.<br><br>Fixes:<br><br>• We made sharing snippets faster, and way less likely to crash on older phones.<br><br>• Fixed the Pro link from our website.<br><br>• Fixed an issue allowing the same snippet to be added to a mashed video multiple times<br><br>• Nixed a crash that some users experienced during mashing<br><br>• It's now possible to submit debug logs when you're not using the default Mail app<br><br>• The camera will stop bugging you for location access<br><br>• We fixed a bug where your videos that were recorded today wouldn't show up in 1SE until you relaunched the app.<br><br>• The calendar is even faster at showing which days have videos available on them now!<br><br>We would love to hear any and all feedback.

If you need a clue let’s just say that even more of you should stumble upon it in the *near future*. Alright, on to the changes. This is a bug fix release which may sound boring but who doesn’t like it when things just work better?!<br><br>*NEW*<br><br>- Thumbnails of your private snippets are now blurred everywhere, and we really mean everywhere!<br><br>- Hopefully you like those context menus we added on snippets in Journal projects and Freestyle Collabs, because we brought them all over to Freestyle projects as well.<br><br>*FIXED*<br><br>- This stuff is hard to describe in words but if you tried to rotate and then flip a snippet and it didn’t do what you expected, especially if you zoomed in, give it another go. We think you’ll be happy with the results!<br><br>- The volume of videos in 1SE now matches what you hear in the Photos app, instead of being louder. Your volume settings will better reflect what you’ll hear in other apps when you share your mashed movies.<br><br>- There are a handful of little improvements and fixes, like hiding the spinner after you edit snippets in a freestyle project, making sure the calendar and day screens agree about your available videos, and scrolling to the bottom of Freestyle Collabs when you open them.<br><br>- We also made a bunch of tweaks to colors for light and dark mode.<br><br>- We fixed a handful of crashes in the media picker, calendar day, and Freestyle screens.<br><br>We would love to hear any and all feedback.
