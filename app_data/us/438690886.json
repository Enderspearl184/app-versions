We've thrown out some old stuff that we just don't use any more, and we've added a shiny new set of attendance buttons to your concert pages. <br><br>And in the spirit of housekeeping: if the app helps get you to your must-see concerts then please take a quick sec to rate it and give us your feedback! We all read every review, every day."},{"version_id":"833384791","version_name":"6.15","version_date":"2019-10-30 09:42:06.000 +0800","version_description":"Every time you launch the Songkick app, you should expect to see what's fresh and what's new - the stuff even your biggest music nerd friend doesn't know about yet. That's your human right as a music fan in 2019. So, say hi to 'Recently added' shows in your Concerts tab - a shiny new rack of events that are hot off the press, fresh out the oven, quick out of the blocks - and other cliches - for you to browse at leisure. Let us know what you think over at @songkick! And keep an eye out for more new stuff coming soon."},{"version_id":"833481235","version_name":"6.16","version_date":"2019-11-06 11:33:11.000 +0800","version_description":"Grab your wellies, it’s festival season (in the Songkick app, at least). You’ll now find a rack of handpicked festivals in your Concerts tab, boasting the best all-dayers and weekenders your tracked artists are playing in the near future through to summer 2020. Take it for a spin and let us know what you think! Oh, and wellies are rain boots, in case that needed translating."}]
